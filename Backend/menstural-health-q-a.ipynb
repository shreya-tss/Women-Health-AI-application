For menstruation in other mammals, see Menstruation (mammal).\\n\\nThis article needs more reliable medical references for verification or relies too heavily on primary sources . Please review the contents of the article and add the appropriate references if you can. Unsourced or poorly sourced material may be challenged and removed .

The menstrual cycle is characterized by the rise and fall of hormones. Menstruation is triggered by falling progesterone levels, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.\\n\\nThe first period, a point in time known as menarche, usually begins between the ages of 11 and 13.[1] Menstruation starting as young as 8 years would still be considered normal.[2] The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world.[3] The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women. In adults, the range is between 21 and 35 days with the average being 28 days.[2][3] Bleeding usually lasts around 2 to 7 days. Periods stop during pregnancy and typically do not resume during the initial months of breastfeeding.[2] Lochia occurs after childbirth.[4] Menstruation, and with it the possibility of pregnancy, ceases after menopause, which usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age.[5]\\n\\nUp to 80% of women do not experience problems sufficient to disrupt daily functioning either during menstruation or in the days leading up to menstruation. Symptoms in advance of menstruation that do interfere with normal life are called premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Some 20 to 30% of women experience PMS, with 3 to 8% experiencing severe symptoms.[6] These include acne, tender breasts, bloating, feeling tired, irritability, and mood changes.[7] Other symptoms some women experience include painful periods (estimates are between 50 and 90%) and heavy bleeding during menstruation and abnormal bleeding at any time during the menstrual cycle.[2] A lack of periods, known as amenorrhea, is when periods do not occur by age 15 or have not re-occurred in 90 days.[2]\\n\\nCharacteristics\\n\\nFurther information: Menstrual cycle\\n\\nLength and duration\\n\\nThe first menstrual period occurs after the onset of pubertal growth, and is called menarche. The average age of menarche is 12 to 15 years.[1][8] However, it may occur as early as eight.[2] The average age of the first period is generally later in the developing world, and earlier in the developed world.[3][9] The average age of menarche has changed little in the United States since the 1950s.[3]\\n\\nMenstruation is the most visible phase of the menstrual cycle and its beginning is used as the marker between cycles. The first day of menstrual bleeding is the date used for the last menstrual period (LMP). The typical length of time between the first day of one period and the first day of the next is 21 to 45 days in young women, and 21 to 35 days in adults.[2][3] The average length is 28 days; one study estimated it at 29.3 days.[10] The variability of menstrual cycle lengths is highest for women under 25 years of age and is lowest, that is, most regular, for ages 25 to 39 years.[11] The variability increases slightly for women aged 40 to 44 years.[11]\\n\\nPerimenopause is when a woman\\'s fertility declines, and menstruation occurs less regularly in the years leading up to the final menstrual period, when a woman stops menstruating completely and is no longer fertile. The medical definition of menopause is one year without a period and typically occurs between 45 and 55 years in Western countries.[5][12]: 381 Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialized countries.[13] Illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than it might have otherwise.[14]\\n\\nBleeding\\n\\nThe average volume of menstrual fluid during a monthly menstrual period is 35 millilitres (2.4 US tbsp) with 10–80 millilitres (0.68–5.41 US tbsp) considered typical. Menstrual fluid is the correct term for the flow, although many people prefer to refer to it as menstrual blood. Menstrual fluid is reddish-brown, a slightly darker color than venous blood.[12]: 381\\n\\nAbout half of menstrual fluid is blood. This blood contains sodium, calcium, phosphate, iron, and chloride, the extent of which depends on the woman. As well as blood, the fluid consists of cervical mucus, vaginal secretions, and endometrial tissue. Vaginal fluids in menses mainly contribute water, common electrolytes, organ moieties, and at least 14 proteins, including glycoproteins.[15]\\n\\nMany women and girls notice blood clots during menstruation. These appear as clumps of blood that may look like tissue. If there was a miscarriage or a stillbirth, examination under a microscope can confirm if it was endometrial tissue or pregnancy tissue (products of conception) that was shed.[16] Sometimes menstrual clots or shed endometrial tissue is incorrectly thought to indicate an early-term miscarriage of an embryo. An enzyme called plasmin – contained in the endometrium – tends to inhibit the blood from clotting.[17]\\n\\nThe amount of iron lost in menstrual fluid is relatively small for most women.[better source needed][18] In one study, premenopausal women who exhibited symptoms of iron deficiency were given endoscopies. 86% of them actually had gastrointestinal disease and were at risk of being misdiagnosed simply because they were menstruating.[non-primary source needed][19] Heavy menstrual bleeding, occurring monthly, can result in anemia.[20]\\n\\nHormonal changes\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Menstrual cycle.[edit]\\n\\nThe menstrual cycle is a series of natural changes in hormone production and the structures of the uterus and ovaries of the female reproductive system that makes pregnancy possible. The ovarian cycle controls the production and release of eggs and the cyclic release of estrogen and progesterone. The uterine cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the lining of the uterus (womb) to receive an embryo. These cycles are concurrent and coordinated, normally last between 21 and 35 days, with a median length of 28 days. Menarche (the onset of the first period) usually occurs around the age of 12 years; menstrual cycles continue for about 30–45 years.\\n\\nNaturally occurring hormones drive the cycles; the cyclical rise and fall of the follicle stimulating hormone prompts the production and growth of oocytes (immature egg cells). The hormone estrogen stimulates the uterus lining (endometrium) to thicken to accommodate an embryo should fertilization occur. The blood supply of the thickened lining provides nutrients to a successfully implanted embryo. If implantation does not occur, the lining breaks down and blood is released. Triggered by falling progesterone levels, menstruation (commonly referred to as a \"period\") is the cyclical shedding of the lining, and is a sign that pregnancy has not occurred.\\n\\nSide effects\\n\\nMenstrual health overview\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Menstrual cycle § Menstrual health.[edit]\\n\\nAlthough a normal and natural process,[21] some women experience premenstrual syndrome with symptoms that may include acne, tender breasts, and tiredness.[22] More severe symptoms that affect daily living are classed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and are experienced by 3 to 8% of women.[23][24][22][25] Dysmenorrhea (menstrual cramps or period pain) is felt as painful cramps in the abdomen that can spread to the back and upper thighs during the first few days of menstruation.[26][27][28] Debilitating period pain is not normal and can be a sign of something severe such as endometriosis.[29] These issues can significantly affect a woman\\'s health and quality of life and timely interventions can improve the lives of these women.[30]\\n\\nThere are common culturally communicated misbeliefs that the menstrual cycle affects women\\'s moods, causes depression or irritability, or that menstruation is a painful, shameful or unclean experience. Often a woman\\'s normal mood variation is falsely attributed to the menstrual cycle. Much of the research is weak, but there appears to be a very small increase in mood fluctuations during the luteal and menstrual phases, and a corresponding decrease during the rest of the cycle.[31] Changing levels of estrogen and progesterone across the menstrual cycle exert systemic effects on aspects of physiology including the brain, metabolism, and musculoskeletal system. The result can be subtle physiological and observable changes to women\\'s athletic performance including strength, aerobic, and anaerobic performance.[32]\\n\\nMoods and premenstrual syndrome (PMS)\\n\\nMain article: Menstruation and mental health\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Premenstrual syndrome.[edit]\\n\\nPremenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a disruptive set of emotional and physical symptoms that regularly occur in the one to two weeks before the start of each menstrual period.[33][34] Symptoms resolve around the time menstrual bleeding begins.[33] Symptoms vary,[35] though commonly include one or more physical, emotional, or behavioral symptoms, that resolve with menses.[36] The range of symptoms is wide, and most commonly are breast tenderness, bloating, headache, mood swings, depression, anxiety, anger, and irritability. To be diagnosed as PMS, rather than a normal discomfort of the menstrual cycle, these symptoms must interfere with daily living, during two menstrual cycles of prospective recording.[36] PMS-related symptoms are often present for about six days.[37] An individual\\'s pattern of symptoms may change over time.[37] PMS does not produce symptoms during pregnancy or following menopause.[38]\\n\\nDiagnosis requires a consistent pattern of emotional and physical symptoms occurring after ovulation and before menstruation to a degree that interferes with normal life.[39] Emotional symptoms must not be present during the initial part of the menstrual cycle.[39] A daily list of symptoms over a few months may help in diagnosis.[37] Other disorders that cause similar symptoms need to be excluded before a diagnosis is made.[37]\\n\\nThe cause of PMS is unknown, but the underlying mechanism is believed to involve changes in hormone levels during the course of the whole menstrual cycle.[38] Reducing salt, alcohol, caffeine, and stress, along with increasing exercise is typically all that is recommended for the management of mild symptoms.[38] Calcium and vitamin D supplementation may be useful in some.[37] Anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen or naproxen may help with physical symptoms.[38] In those with more significant symptoms, birth control pills or the diuretic spironolactone may be useful.[38][37]\\n\\nOver 90% of women report having some premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, headaches, and moodiness.[35] Premenstrual symptoms generally do not cause substantial disruption, and qualify as PMS in approximately 20% of pre-menopausal women.[33] Antidepressants of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) class may be used to treat the emotional symptoms of PMS.[33]\\n\\nPremenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) is a more severe condition that has greater psychological symptoms.[37][38] PMDD affects about 3% of women of child-bearing age.[33]\\n\\nCramps\\n\\nIn most women, various physical changes are brought about by fluctuations in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. This includes muscle contractions of the uterus (menstrual cramping) that can precede or accompany menstruation. Many women experience painful cramps, also known as dysmenorrhea, during menstruation.[40] Among adult women, that pain is severe enough to affect daily activity in only 2%–28%.[40] Severe symptoms that disrupt daily activities and functioning may be diagnosed as premenstrual dysphoric disorder.[41] These symptoms can be severe enough to affect a person\\'s performance at work, school, and in everyday activities in a small percentage of women.[6]\\n\\nWhen severe pelvic pain and bleeding suddenly occur or worsen during a cycle, this could be due to ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. This is checked by using a pregnancy test, ideally as soon as unusual pain begins, because ectopic pregnancies can be life‑threatening.[42]\\n\\nThe most common treatment for menstrual cramps are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs can be used to reduce moderate to severe pain, and all appear similar.[43] About 1 in 5 women do not respond to NSAIDs and require alternative therapy, such as simple analgesics or heat pads.[44] Other medications for pain management include aspirin or paracetamol and combined oral contraceptives. Although combined oral contraceptives may be used, there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of intrauterine progestogens.[43]\\n\\nOne review found tentative evidence that acupuncture may be useful, at least in the short term.[45] Another review found insufficient evidence to determine an effect.[46]\\n\\nInteractions with other conditions\\n\\nKnown interactions between the menstrual cycle and certain health conditions include:\\n\\nSome women with neurological conditions experience increased activity of their conditions at about the same time during each menstrual cycle. For example, drops in estrogen levels may trigger migraines,[medical citation needed] [47] especially when the woman who has migraines is also taking the birth control pill.\\n\\nMany women with epilepsy have more seizures in a pattern linked to the menstrual cycle; this is called \"catamenial epilepsy\".[48] Different patterns seem to exist (such as seizures coinciding with the time of menstruation, or coinciding with the time of ovulation), and the frequency with which they occur has not been firmly established.\\n\\nResearch indicates that women have a significantly higher likelihood of anterior cruciate ligament injuries in the pre-ovulatory stage, than post-ovulatory stage.[49]\\n\\nSexual activity\\n\\nFurther information: Culture and menstruation\\n\\nSexual feelings and behaviors change during the menstrual cycle. Before and during ovulation, high levels of estrogen and androgens result in women having a relatively increased interest in sexual activity, and relatively lower interest directly prior to and during menstruation.[50] Unlike other mammals, women may show interest in sexual activity across all days of the menstrual cycle, regardless of fertility.[51]\\n\\nThere is no reliable scientific evidence that would advise against sexual intercourse during menstruation based on medical grounds.[medical citation needed]\\n\\nFertility aspects\\n\\nPeak fertility (the time with the highest likelihood of pregnancy resulting from sexual intercourse) occurs during just a few days of the cycle: usually two days before and two days after the ovulation date.[52] This corresponds to the second and the beginning of the third week in a 28-day cycle. This fertile window varies from woman to woman, just as the ovulation date often varies from cycle to cycle for the same woman.[53] A variety of methods have been developed to help individual women estimate the relatively fertile and the relatively infertile days in the cycle; these systems are called fertility awareness.[medical citation needed]\\n\\nMenstrual disorders\\n\\nMain article: Menstrual disorder\\n\\nInfrequent or irregular ovulation is called oligoovulation.[54] The absence of ovulation is called anovulation. Normal menstrual flow can occur without ovulation preceding it: an anovulatory cycle. In some cycles, follicular development may start but not be completed; nevertheless, estrogens will be formed and stimulate the uterine lining. Anovulatory flow resulting from a very thick endometrium caused by prolonged, continued high estrogen levels is called estrogen breakthrough bleeding. Anovulatory bleeding triggered by a sudden drop in estrogen levels is called withdrawal bleeding.[55] Anovulatory cycles commonly occur before menopause (perimenopause) and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome.[56]\\n\\nVery little flow (less than 10 ml) is called hypomenorrhea. Regular cycles with intervals of 21 days or fewer are polymenorrhea; frequent but irregular menstruation is known as metrorrhagia. Sudden heavy flows or amounts greater than 80 ml are termed menorrhagia.[57] Heavy menstruation that occurs frequently and irregularly is menometrorrhagia. The term for cycles with intervals exceeding 35 days is oligomenorrhea.[58] Amenorrhea refers to more than three[57] to six[58] months without menses (while not being pregnant) during a woman\\'s reproductive years. The term for painful periods is dysmenorrhea.\\n\\nThere is a wide spectrum of differences in how women experience menstruation. There are several ways that someone\\'s menstrual cycle can differ from the norm:\\n\\nTerm Meaning Oligomenorrhea Infrequent periods Hypomenorrhea Short or light periods Polymenorrhea Frequent periods (more frequently than every 21 days) Hypermenorrhea Heavy or long periods (soaking a sanitary napkin or tampon every hour, menstruating longer than 7 days) Dysmenorrhea Painful periods Intermenstrual bleeding Breakthrough bleeding (also called spotting) Amenorrhea Absent periods\\n\\nExtreme psychological stress can also result in periods stopping.[59] More severe symptoms of anxiety or depression may be signs of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) which is a depressive disorder.[60]\\n\\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding is a hormonally caused bleeding abnormality. Dysfunctional uterine bleeding typically occurs in premenopausal women who do not ovulate normally (i.e. are anovulatory). All these bleeding abnormalities need medical attention; they may indicate hormone imbalances, uterine fibroids, or other problems. As pregnant women may bleed, a pregnancy test forms part of the evaluation of abnormal bleeding.[medical citation needed]\\n\\nWomen who had undergone female genital mutilation (particularly type III- infibulation) a practice common in parts of Africa, may experience menstrual problems, such as slow and painful menstruation, that is caused by the near-complete sealing off of the vagina.[61]\\n\\nDysmenorrhea\\n\\nThis section is an excerpt from Dysmenorrhea.[edit]\\n\\nDysmenorrhea, also known as period pain, painful periods or menstrual cramps, is pain during menstruation.[62][63][64] Its usual onset occurs around the time that menstruation begins.[65] Symptoms typically last less than three days.[65] The pain is usually in the pelvis or lower abdomen.[65] Other symptoms may include back pain, diarrhea or nausea.[65]\\n\\nDysmenorrhea can occur without an underlying problem.[66][67] Underlying issues that can cause dysmenorrhea include uterine fibroids, adenomyosis, and most commonly, endometriosis.[66] It is more common among those with heavy periods, irregular periods, those whose periods started before twelve years of age and those who have a low body weight.[65] A pelvic exam and ultrasound in individuals who are sexually active may be useful for diagnosis.[65] Conditions that should be ruled out include ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain.[65]\\n\\nDysmenorrhea occurs less often in those who exercise regularly and those who have children early in life.[65] Treatment may include the use of a heating pad.[66] Medications that may help include NSAIDs such as ibuprofen, hormonal birth control and the IUD with progestogen.[65][66] Taking vitamin B1 or magnesium may help.[64] Evidence for yoga, acupuncture and massage is insufficient.[65] Surgery may be useful if certain underlying problems are present.[64]\\n\\nEstimates of the percentage of female adolescents and women of reproductive age affected are between 50% and 90%.[62][67] It is the most common menstrual disorder.[64] Typically, it starts within a year of the first menstrual period.[65] When there is no underlying cause, often the pain improves with age or following having a child.[64]\\n\\nMenstrual hygiene management\\n\\nMain articles: Menstrual hygiene management and Feminine hygiene\\n\\nDisposable sanitary napkin\\n\\nDisposable sanitary napkin\\n\\nTampon in plastic applicator\\n\\nThe elements of a tampon with applicator. Left: the bigger tube (\"penetrator\"). Center: cotton tampon with attached string. Right: the narrower tube.\\n\\nMenstrual cup\\n\\nMenstrual cup\\n\\nCloth menstrual pad\\n\\nCloth menstrual pad\\n\\nMenstrual products (also called \"feminine hygiene\" products) are made to absorb or catch menstrual blood. A number of different products are available – some are disposable, some are reusable. Where women can afford it, items used to absorb or catch menses are usually commercially manufactured products. Menstruating women manage menstruation primarily by wearing menstrual products such as tampons, napkins or menstrual cups to catch the menstrual blood.\\n\\nThe main disposable products (commercially manufactured) include:\\n\\nSanitary napkins (also called sanitary towels or pads) – Rectangular pieces of material worn attached to the underwear to absorb menstrual flow, often with an adhesive backing to hold the pad in place. Disposable pads may contain wood pulp or gel products, usually with a plastic lining and bleached.\\n\\nTampons – Disposable cylinders of treated rayon/cotton blends or all-cotton fleece, usually bleached, that are inserted into the vagina to absorb menstrual flow.\\n\\nThe main reusable products include:\\n\\nMenstrual cups – A firm, flexible bell-shaped device worn inside the vagina to collect menstrual flow.\\n\\nReusable cloth pads – Pads that are made of cotton (often organic), terrycloth, or flannel, and may be handsewn (from material or reused old clothes and towels) or storebought.\\n\\nPadded panties or period-proof underwear – Reusable cloth (usually cotton) underwear with extra absorbent layers sewn in to absorb flow.\\n\\nDue to poverty, some women cannot afford commercial feminine hygiene products.[68][69] Instead, they use materials found in the environment or other improvised materials.[70][71] \"Period poverty\" is a global issue affecting women and girls who do not have access to safe, hygienic sanitary products.[72] In addition, solid waste disposal systems in developing countries are often lacking, which means women have no proper place to dispose used products, such as pads.[73] Inappropriate disposal of used materials also creates pressures on sanitation systems as menstrual hygiene products can create blockages of toilets, pipes and sewers.[68] In the UK research has shown that for women allotment growers, access to sanitation for menstrual hygiene management is limited.[74]\\n\\nMenstrual suppression\\n\\nMain article: Menstrual suppression\\n\\nDue to hormonal contraception\\n\\nMain article: Hormonal contraception\\n\\nMenstruation can be delayed by the use of progesterone or progestins. For this purpose, oral administration of progesterone or progestin during cycle day 20 has been found to effectively delay menstruation for at least 20 days, with menstruation starting after 2–3 days have passed since discontinuing the regimen.[75]\\n\\nHormonal contraception affects the frequency, duration, severity, volume, and regularity of menstruation and menstrual symptoms. The most common form of hormonal contraception is the combined birth control pill, which contains both estrogen and progestogen. Although the primary function of the pill is to prevent pregnancy, it may be used to improve some menstrual symptoms and syndromes which affect menstruation, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), endometriosis, adenomyosis, amenorrhea, menstrual cramps, menstrual migraines, menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), menstruation-related or fibroid-related anemia and dysmenorrhea (painful menstruation) by creating regularity in menstrual cycles and reducing overall menstrual flow.[76][77]\\n\\nUsing the combined birth control pill, it is also possible for a woman to delay or eliminate menstrual periods, a practice called menstrual suppression.[78] Some women do this simply for convenience in the short-term,[79] while others prefer to eliminate periods altogether when possible. This can be done either by skipping the placebo pills, or using an extended cycle combined oral contraceptive pill, which were first marketed in the U.S. in the early 2000s. This continuous administration of active pills without the placebo can lead to the achievement of amenorrhea in 80% of users within 1 year of use.[80]\\n\\nDue to breastfeeding\\n\\nMain article: Lactational amenorrhea\\n\\nBreastfeeding causes negative feedback to occur on pulse secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).[81] Depending on the strength of the negative feedback, breastfeeding women may experience complete suppression of follicular development, follicular development but no ovulation, or normal menstrual cycles may resume.[82] Suppression of ovulation is more likely when suckling occurs more frequently.[83] The production of prolactin in response to suckling is important to maintaining lactational amenorrhea.[84] On average, women who are fully breastfeeding whose infants suckle frequently experience a return of menstruation at fourteen and a half months postpartum. There is a wide range of response among individual breastfeeding women, however, with some experiencing return of menstruation at two months and others remaining amenorrheic for up to 42 months postpartum.[85]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\nMain article: Culture and menstruation\\n\\nEtymology and terminology\\n\\nThe word menstruation is etymologically related to moon. The terms menstruation and menses are derived from the Latin mensis \\'month\\', which in turn relates to the ancient Greek mene \\'moon\\' and to the roots of the English words month and moon.[86]\\n\\nSome organizations have begun to use the term \"menstruator\" instead of \"menstruating women\", a term that has been in use since at least 2010.[87] Menstruator is used by activists and scholars in order to \"express solidarity with women who do not menstruate, transgender men who do, and intersexual and genderqueer individuals\".[87]: 950 The term can be contentious between different schools of feminist thought; however, the majority of feminist scholars consider the term to correctly reflect the reality that people of different genders menstruate.[87]: 950 The term \"people who menstruate\" is also used.[88]\\n\\nTraditions, taboos and education\\n\\nSee also: Menstruation in Islam, Woman prayer, and Istihadha\\n\\nMany religions have menstruation-related traditions, for example: Islam prohibits sexual contact with women during menstruation in the 2nd chapter of the Quran.[89] Some scholars argue that menstruating women are in a state in which they are unable to maintain wudhu, and are therefore prohibited from touching the Arabic version of the Qur\\'an.[90] In Judaism, a woman during menstruation is called Niddah and may be banned from certain actions. For example, the Jewish Torah prohibits sexual intercourse with a menstruating woman.[91] In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally considered ritually impure and given rules to follow.[92][93] In Zoroastrianism, if a woman’s menses did not stop after nine days, it was considered the work of the daēvas.[94]\\n\\nMenstruation education is frequently taught in combination with sex education at school in Western countries, although girls may prefer their mothers to be the primary source of information about menstruation and puberty.[95] Information about menstruation is often shared among friends and peers, which may promote a more positive outlook on puberty.[96] The quality of menstrual education in a society determines the accuracy of people\\'s understanding of the process.[97] In many Western countries where menstruation is a taboo subject, girls tend to conceal the fact that they may be menstruating and struggle to ensure that they give no sign of menstruation.[97] Effective educational programs are essential to providing children and adolescents with clear and accurate information about menstruation. Schools can be an appropriate place for menstrual education to take place.[98] Programs led by peers or third-party agencies are another option.[98] Low-income girls are less likely to receive proper sex education on puberty, leading to a decreased understanding of why menstruation occurs and the associated physiological changes that take place. This has been shown to cause the development of a negative attitude towards menstruation.[99]\\n\\nSeclusion during menstruation\\n\\nFurther information: Chhaupadi and Seclusion of girls at puberty\\n\\nIn some cultures, women were isolated during menstruation due to menstrual taboos.[100] This is because they are seen as unclean, dangerous, or bringing bad luck to those who encounter them. These practices are common in parts of South Asia including India.[101] A 1983 report found women refraining from household chore during this period in India.[102] Chhaupadi is a social practice that occurs in the western part of Nepal for Hindu women, which prohibits a woman from participating in everyday activities during menstruation. Women are considered impure during this time and are kept out of the house and have to live in a shed. Although chhaupadi was outlawed by the Supreme Court of Nepal in 2005, the tradition is slow to change.[103][104] Women and girls in cultures which practice such seclusion are often confined to menstruation huts, which are places of isolation used by cultures with strong menstrual taboos. The practice has recently come under fire due to related fatalities. Nepal criminalized the practice in 2017 after deaths were reported after the elongated isolation periods, but \"the practice of isolating menstruating women and girls continues.\"[105] Not all cultures villainize menstruation, the Beng people of West Africa consider menstrual blood as sacred and recognize its significance in reproduction.[106]\\n\\nBeliefs around synchrony\\n\\nEffects of the moon\\n\\nSee also: Lunar effect\\n\\nEven though the average length of the human menstrual cycle is similar to that of the lunar cycle, in modern humans there is no relation between the two.[107] The relationship is believed to be a coincidence.[108][109] Light exposure does not appear to affect the menstrual cycle in humans.[110] A meta-analysis of studies from 1996 showed no correlation between the human menstrual cycle and the lunar cycle,[111] nor did data analyzed by period-tracking app Clue, submitted by 1.5 million women, of 7.5 million menstrual cycles; however, the lunar cycle and the average menstrual cycle were found to be basically equal in length.[112]\\n\\nCohabitation\\n\\nBeginning in 1971, some research suggested that menstrual cycles of cohabiting women became synchronized (menstrual synchrony).[113] Subsequent research has called this hypothesis into question.[114] A 2013 review concluded that menstrual synchrony likely does not exist.[115]\\n\\nWork\\n\\nSome countries, mainly in Asia, have menstrual leave to provide women with either paid or unpaid leave of absence from their employment while they are menstruating.[116] Countries with policies include Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea.[117][118] The practice is controversial due to concerns that it bolsters the perception of women as weak, inefficient workers,[116] as well as concerns that it is unfair to men,[119][120] and that it furthers gender stereotypes and the medicalization of menstruation.[117]\\n\\nOther mammals\\n\\nMain articles: Menstrual cycle § Evolution and other species, and Menstruation (mammal)\\n\\nMost female mammals have an estrous cycle, but not all have a menstrual cycle that results in menstruation. Menstruation in mammals occurs in some close evolutionary relatives such as chimpanzees.[121]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\nNiddah (Jewish laws of menstruation)\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n^ a b Women\\'s Gynecologic Health.

Here are answers to some common questions.\\n\\nWhen Do Periods Usually Start?\\n\\nMost girls get their first period when they're around 12. But sometimes it comes a few years earlier or later. Every girl's body has its own schedule.\\n\\nThere isn't one right age for a girl to get her period. But signs to watch for include:\\n\\nbreasts starting to develop (periods usually start about 2 years after this)\\n\\nhair growing under a girl's arms and in her private parts\\n\\nseeing or feeling vaginal discharge fluid (sort of like mucus), which usually begins about 6 months to a year before a girl gets her first period\\n\\nWhat Causes a Period?\\n\\nA period happens because of changes in in the body. Hormones are chemical messengers. The ovaries release the female hormones and , which cause the lining of the uterus (or womb) to build up. The built-up lining is ready for a fertilized egg (an egg that has joined with a sperm) to attach to and develop into a baby. If there is no fertilized egg, the lining breaks down and bleeds. Then the same process happens all over again.\\n\\n\\n\\nIt usually takes about a month for the lining to build up, then break down. That is why most females get their periods around once a month.\\n\\nHow Does Ovulation Relate to Periods?\\n\\nOvulation (pronounced: ov-yoo-LAY-shun) is the release of an egg from the ovaries. The same hormones that cause the uterus lining to build up also cause an egg to leave one of the ovaries. The egg travels through a thin tube called a fallopian tube to the uterus.\\n\\nIf the egg is fertilized by a sperm cell, it attaches to the wall of the uterus, where over time it develops into a baby. If the egg is not fertilized, the uterus lining breaks down and bleeds, causing a period.\\n\\nDo Periods Happen Regularly When Menstruation Starts?\\n\\nFor the first few years after a girl starts her period, it might not come regularly. This is normal at first. By about 2–3 years after her first period, a girl's periods should be coming around once every 4–5 weeks.\\n\\nCan a Girl Get Pregnant as Soon as Her Period Starts?\\n\\nYes, a girl can get pregnant as soon as her period starts. A girl can even get pregnant right before her very first period because her hormones might already be active. The hormones may have led to ovulation and the building of the uterine wall. If so and the girl has sex, she can get pregnant, even though she has never had a period.\\n\\nHow Long Do Periods Last?\\n\\nPeriods usually last about 5 days. But a period can be shorter or last longer.\\n\\nHow Often Does a Period Happen?\\n\\nPeriods usually happen about once every 4–5 weeks. But some girls get their periods a little less or more often.\\n\\nShould I Use a Pad, Tampon, or Menstrual Cup?\\n\\nYou have many choices about how to deal with period blood. You may need to experiment a bit to find which works best for you. Some girls use only one method and others switch between different methods.\\n\\nMost girls use pads when they first get their period. Pads are made of cotton and come in lots of different sizes and shapes. They have sticky strips that attach to the underwear.\\n\\nMany girls find tampons more convenient than pads, especially when playing sports or swimming. A tampon is a cotton plug that you put into your vagina. Most tampons come with an applicator that guides the tampon into place. The tampon absorbs the blood. Don't leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours because this can increase your risk of a serious infection called toxic shock syndrome.\\n\\nSome girls prefer a menstrual cup. Most are made of silicone. To use a menstrual cup, a girl inserts it into her vagina. It holds the blood until she empties it.\\n\\nHow Much Blood Comes Out?\\n\\nIt may look like a lot of blood, but a girl usually only loses a few tablespoons of blood during the whole period. Most girls need to change their pad, tampon, or menstrual cup about 3‒6 times a day.\\n\\nWill I Have Periods for the Rest of My Life?\\n\\nWhen women reach menopause (around age 45‒55), their periods will permanently stop. Periods also stop during pregnancy.\\n\\nWhat Is PMS?\\n\\nPMS (premenstrual syndrome) is when emotional and physical symptoms happen before or during a girl's period. These can include moodiness, sadness, anxiety, bloating, and acne. The symptoms go away after the first few days of a period.\\n\\nWhat Can I Do About Cramps?\\n\\nMany girls have cramps with their period, especially in the first few days. If cramps bother you, you can try:\\n\\na warm heating pad on your belly\\n\\ntaking ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, or store brand) or naproxen (Aleve or store brand)\\n\\nWhen Should I Call the Doctor?\\n\\nMost girls don't have any problems with their periods. But call your doctor if you:\\n\\nare 15 and haven't started your period\\n\\nhave had your period for more than 2 years and it's still not regular (coming about every 4–5 weeks)\\n\\nhave bleeding between periods\\n\\nhave severe cramps that don't get better with ibuprofen or naproxen\\n\\nhave very heavy bleeding (bleeding that goes through a pad or tampon faster than every 1 hour)\\n\\nhave periods that last more than about a week\\n\\nhave severe PMS that gets in the way of your everyday activities\\n\\nWhat Else Should I Know?\\n\\nPeriods are a natural, healthy part of life. They shouldn't get in the way of exercising, having fun, and enjoying life. If you have questions about periods, ask your doctor, a parent, health teacher, school nurse, or older sister.\\n\\nThe Menstrual Cycle\\n\\nThe Menstrual Cycle\\n\\nThis video shows what happens during the menstrual cycle – and why.\\n\\nMedically reviewed by: Amy W.

The bleeding tends to be heaviest in the first 2 days.\\n\\nWhen your period is at its heaviest, the blood will be red.

Most girls will be having regular periods by age 16 to 18.\\n\\nRead more about early or delayed puberty.\\n\\nPeriod products\\n\\nPeriod products soak up or collect the blood released during your period. The main types of period products are:\\n\\npads\\n\\ntampons\\n\\nmenstrual cups\\n\\nPads\\n\\nPads are strips of padding that have a sticky side you attach to your underwear to hold them in place. One side of the pad is made of an absorbent material that soaks up the blood.\\n\\nPads come in many sizes, so you can choose one to suit how heavy or light your period is.\\n\\nYou can also get reusable washable pads.\\n\\nPantyliners are a smaller and thinner type of pad that can be used on days when your period is very light.\\n\\nTampons\\n\\nTampons are small tubes of cotton wool that you insert into your vagina to soak up the blood before it comes out of your body.\\n\\nThere are 2 types of tampon – ones that come with an applicator and others without an applicator that you insert with your fingers. In both cases, there's a string at one end of the tampon, which you pull to remove it.\\n\\nTampons come with instructions that explain how to use them. If the tampon is inserted correctly, you should not be able to feel it inside you. If you can feel it or it hurts, it might not be in properly.\\n\\nIt is not possible for a tampon to get lost inside you. Your vagina holds it firmly in place and it expands inside you as it soaks up the blood.\\n\\nMenstrual cups\\n\\nMenstrual cups are an alternative to pads and tampons. The cup is made from silicone and you put it inside your vagina.\\n\\nMenstrual cups collect the blood rather than absorb it. Unlike tampons and most pads, which are thrown away after they've been used, you can wash menstrual cups and use them again.\\n\\nPeriod underwear\\n\\nPeriod underwear are pants made from absorbent fabric. They soak up blood in the same way as pads, and have a layer to prevent leaks. They're designed to be washed and reused.\\n\\nPMS (premenstrual syndrome)\\n\\nChanges in your body's hormone levels before your period can cause physical and emotional changes.\\n\\nThis is known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome) or PMT (premenstrual tension).\\n\\nThere are many possible symptoms of PMS, but typical symptoms include:\\n\\nfeeling bloated\\n\\nbreast tenderness\\n\\nmood swings\\n\\nfeeling irritable\\n\\nspotty skin\\n\\nlow sex drive (loss of libido)\\n\\nheadaches\\n\\nThese symptoms usually improve when your period starts and disappear a few days afterwards. Not all women who have periods get PMS.\\n\\nGetting pregnant\\n\\nWorking out when you can get pregnant – your fertile time – can be difficult. It's around the time you ovulate, which is about 12 to 16 days before the start of your next period.\\n\\nBut sperm can survive inside a woman's body for up to 7 days before ovulation occurs. This means your fertile time extends back earlier in your cycle.\\n\\nYou can calculate when your period will start and your peak ovulation times using an online period calendar.\\n\\nYou cannot get pregnant if you do not ovulate. Some hormonal methods of contraception, such as the combined contraceptive pill, contraceptive patch and contraceptive injection, work by preventing ovulation.\\n\\nRead more about periods and fertility in the menstrual cycle, infertility, contraception and trying to get pregnant.\\n\\nChanges in your periods\\n\\nYour periods can change – for example, they may last longer or get lighter. This does not necessarily mean there's a problem, but it does need to be investigated.\\n\\nYou can see your GP, or visit your nearest women's clinic or contraceptive clinic.\\n\\nBleeding between periods, bleeding after having sex, or bleeding after the menopause needs to be checked by a doctor.\\n\\nIt might be caused by an infection, abnormalities in the neck of the womb (the cervix) or, in rare cases, it could be cancer.\\n\\nYou could be pregnant if you miss a period and you've had sex. See your GP if you've taken a pregnancy test and the result is negative (you're not pregnant) and you've missed 3 consecutive periods.\\n\\nThey will investigate the cause and recommend any necessary treatment.\\n\\nRead more about stopped or missed periods.\\n\\nWhen do periods stop?\\n\\nYour periods will continue until you reach the menopause, which usually happens when you are in your mid-40s to mid-50s. In the UK the average age of menopause is 51.\\n\\nYour periods will not usually stop suddenly when you go through the menopause. They may start to become less frequent over a few months or years before stopping altogether.\\n\\nDelaying your period\\n\\nIt’s possible to delay your period if you take the combined contraceptive pill.\\n\\nHow you do this depends on the type of combined pill you take. Speak to a GP or pharmacist, or a doctor or nurse at a sexual health clinic, about how to delay your period using the combined pill.\\n\\nIf you do not take the combined pill already, you will need to start it a few weeks before the time you want to delay your period.\\n\\nIf you do not want to take the contraceptive pill, your GP can prescribe a medicine called norethisterone to delay your periods, but this is not suitable for everyone.\\n\\nVideo: Menstrual cycle\\n\\nThis animation explains in detail how the menstrual cycle works.\\n\\nMedia last reviewed: 21 October 2023 Media review due: 21 October 2026\\n\\nPage last reviewed: 05 January 2023 Next review due: 05 January 2026\"), Document(metadata={'source': 'https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/10132-menstrual-cycle'}, page_content=\"Locations:\\n\\nAbu Dhabi|Canada|Florida|London|Nevada|Ohio|\\n\\nGray gradient\\n\\nGray gradient\\n\\nCleveland Clinic logo\\n\\nHome/\\n\\nHealth Library/\\n\\nArticles/\\n\\nMenstrual Cycle\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMenstrual Cycle\\n\\nA menstrual cycle begins when you get your period or menstruate. This is when you shed the lining of your uterus. This cycle is part of your reproductive system and prepares your body for a possible pregnancy. A typical cycle lasts between 24 and 38 days.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission.

Policy\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nFind Your Ob/Gyn\\n\\nMake an Appointment\\n\\nWhat is menstruation?\\n\\nMenstruation is the monthly shedding of the lining of your uterus. Menstruation is also known by the terms menses, menstrual period, menstrual cycle or period. Menstrual blood — which is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of your uterus — flows from your uterus through your cervix and out of your body through your vagina.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\\n\\nMenstruation is driven by hormones. Hormones are chemical messengers in your body. Your pituitary gland (in your brain) and your ovaries (part of your reproductive system) make and release certain hormones at certain times during your menstrual cycle.\\n\\nThese hormones cause the lining of your uterus to thicken. This happens so that if a pregnancy would occur, an egg can implant into your uterine lining. Hormones also cause your ovaries to release an egg (ovulation). The egg moves down your fallopian tubes, where it waits for sperm. If a sperm doesn’t fertilize that egg, pregnancy doesn’t occur. The lining of your uterus breaks down and sheds. This is your period.\\n\\nWhat is a menstrual cycle?\\n\\nThe menstrual cycle is a term to describe the sequence of events that occur in your body as it prepares for the possibility of pregnancy each month. Your menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of your menstrual period until the first day of your next menstrual period. Every person’s cycle is slightly different, but the process is the same.\\n\\nHow long is a normal menstrual cycle?\\n\\nThe average length of a menstrual cycle is 28 days. However, a cycle can range in length from 21 days to about 35 days and still be normal.\\n\\nHow many days between periods is normal?\\n\\nThe days between periods is your menstrual cycle length. The average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. However, cycles lasting as little as 21 days or as long as 35 days can be normal.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nHow long does a normal period last?\\n\\nMost people have their period (bleed) for between three and seven days.\\n\\nIs a three-day period normal?\\n\\nA period is normal if it’s anywhere between three and seven days. While on the shorter end of the range, some people have a menstrual period for three days. This is OK.\\n\\nWhat are the four phases of the menstrual cycle?\\n\\nThe rise and fall of your hormones trigger the steps in your menstrual cycle. Your hormones cause the organs of your reproductive tract to respond in certain ways. The specific events that occur during your menstrual cycle are:\\n\\nThe menses phase: This phase begins on the first day of your period. It's when the lining of your uterus sheds through your vagina if pregnancy hasn’t occurred. Most people bleed for three to five days, but a period lasting only three days to as many as seven days is usually not a cause for worry.\\n\\nThe follicular phase: This phase begins on the day you get your period and ends at ovulation (it overlaps with the menses phase and ends when you ovulate). During this time, the level of the hormone estrogen rises, which causes the lining of your uterus (the endometrium) to grow and thicken. In addition, another hormone — follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) — causes follicles in your ovaries to grow. During days 10 to 14, one of the developing follicles will form a fully mature egg (ovum).\\n\\nOvulation: This phase occurs roughly at about day 14 in a 28-day menstrual cycle. A sudden increase in another hormone — luteinizing hormone (LH) — causes your ovary to release its egg. This event is ovulation.\\n\\nThe luteal phase: This phase lasts from about day 15 to day 28. Your egg leaves your ovary and begins to travel through your fallopian tubes to your uterus. The level of the hormone progesterone rises to help prepare your uterine lining for pregnancy. If the egg becomes fertilized by sperm and attaches itself to your uterine wall (implantation), you become pregnant. If pregnancy doesn’t occur, estrogen and progesterone levels drop and the thick lining of your uterus sheds during your period.\\n\\nAt what age does menstruation typically begin?\\n\\nPeople start menstruating at the average age of 12. However, you can begin menstruating as early as 8 years old or as late as 16 years old. Generally, most people menstruate within a few years of growing breasts and pubic hair.\\n\\nPeople stop menstruating at menopause, which occurs at about the age of 51. At menopause, you stop producing eggs (stop ovulating). You’ve reached menopause when you haven’t gotten a period in one year.\\n\\nWhat are symptoms of getting your period?\\n\\nSome people experience symptoms of menstruation and others don’t. The intensity of these symptoms can also vary. The most common symptom is cramps. The cramping you feel in your pelvic area is your uterus contracting to release its lining.\\n\\nOther signs you’re getting your period are:\\n\\nMood changes.\\n\\nTrouble sleeping.\\n\\nHeadache.\\n\\nFood cravings.\\n\\nBloating.\\n\\nBreast tenderness.\\n\\nAcne.\\n\\nHow does your period change over time?\\n\\nYour menstrual cycle can change from your teen years to your 40s or 50s. When you first get your period, it’s normal to have longer cycles or a heavier period flow. It can take up to three years for young people to have regular cycles after they begin menstruating. A normal menstrual cycle is a cycle that:\\n\\nOccurs roughly every 21 to 35 days.\\n\\nCauses bleeding for between three and seven days.\\n\\nOnce you reach your 20s, your cycles become more consistent and regular. Once your body begins transitioning to menopause, your periods will change again and become more irregular.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nIt’s also normal for your period to change during other life events that affect your hormones, such as after childbirth or when you’re lactating.\\n\\nWhat is considered an irregular period?\\n\\nIrregular menstruation describes anything that’s not a normal menstrual period. Some examples of an irregular period are:\\n\\nPeriods that occur less than 21 days or more than 35 days apart.\\n\\nNot having a period for three months (or 90 days).\\n\\nMenstrual flow that’s much heavier or lighter than usual.\\n\\nPeriod bleeding that lasts longer than seven days.\\n\\nPeriods that are accompanied by severe pain, cramping, nausea or vomiting.\\n\\nBleeding or spotting that happens between periods.\\n\\nHow much should I bleed during my period?\\n\\nYou can expect to lose between two and three tablespoons (tbsp.) of blood during your period. Some signs of irregular period bleeding are:\\n\\nBleeding through a tampon or pad every one to two hours.\\n\\nPassing blood clots larger than a quarter.\\n\\nBleeding longer than seven days each time you have your period.\\n\\nIt’s normal to experience some variation in the amount of bleeding each cycle. It’s also important to remember your normal may be different than someone else’s. Try not to compare. Talk to a healthcare provider if you’re concerned about irregular or severe bleeding during your period.\\n\\nHow do I track my period?\\n\\nIt’s a good idea to be aware of your menstrual period. Not getting a period may not seem like a big deal, but an irregular period can be a sign of a problem. Your healthcare provider will ask you about your most recent period and menstrual cycles. Knowing what’s normal for you can be very helpful to your provider.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nTracking your period can also be helpful in knowing when you ovulate, which is when you’re most likely to get pregnant. It can also help you plan ahead or prepare for period bleeding during a special event or vacation.\\n\\nTo track your period:\\n\\nMark the first day of your period on a calendar with an X. This is day one.\\n\\nContinue to mark each day you’re bleeding with an X. Stop marking when your bleeding stops.\\n\\nWhen bleeding starts again, mark it with an X. This is day one again.\\n\\nYou can then count the number of days between each first X to get the length of your cycle. Count the number of X’s to see how many days bleeding lasts.\\n\\nThere are also apps that do all of this for you that you can download on your phone or tablet.\\n\\nWhen should I worry about my period?\\n\\nContact your healthcare provider if:\\n\\nYou haven’t had a period by the age of 16.\\n\\nYou don’t get your period for three months or longer.\\n\\nYou’re suddenly bleeding for more days than usual.\\n\\nYou’re bleeding much lighter or much heavier than usual.\\n\\nYou have severe pain during your period.\\n\\nYou have bleeding between periods.\\n\\nYou feel sick after using tampons.\\n\\nYou think you might be pregnant — for example, you’ve had sex and your period is at least five days late.\\n\\nYour period hasn’t come back within three months of stopping birth control pills and you know you’re not pregnant.\\n\\nYou have any questions or concerns about your period or possible pregnancy.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nYour menstrual cycle provides valuable insight to your healthcare provider about your reproductive health. A normal menstrual cycle can last between 21 and 35 days. You can expect to bleed between three and seven days each time you get your period. Contact your healthcare provider if you have questions or concerns about your menstrual cycle. In some cases, an irregular cycle could mean you have a health condition that needs treatment.\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nYour Ob/Gyn is there for you throughout many different parts of your life.

With each cycle your body prepares the lining of your uterus to create the ideal environment for a possible pregnancy.\\n\\nWhy do we have periods?\\n\\nYour menstrual cycle is the time between one period and the next. Every month there is a complex interaction between the pituitary gland in the brain, the ovaries and the uterus (or womb). Messages and hormones are being passed around the body to prepare it for a possible pregnancy. An egg is produced, the lining of the uterus thickens up, hormones prepare the vagina and the cervix to accept and support sperm. When pregnancy doesn't occur, the egg is absorbed back into the body and the thick lining in the uterus is shed, this is your period. Then the cycle begins all over again.\\n\\nDay one of your cycle is the first day of your period. This is when your uterus starts shedding the lining it has built up over the last 28 days.\\n\\nAfter your period is over, the lining of your uterus starts to build up again to become a thick and spongy ‘nest’ in preparation for a possible pregnancy.\\n\\nOn day 14 (for most women), one of your ovaries will release an egg, which will make its way through a fallopian tube and will eventually make its way to your uterus (called ovulation).\\n\\nOn day 28 (for most women), if you have not become pregnant, the lining of your uterus starts to shed. This is your period. The blood you lose during your period is the lining of your uterus.\\n\\nThe menstrual cycle\\n\\nIf you have sex during a cycle, and your egg meets a sperm, you can become pregnant. When you’re pregnant, you don’t get your period.\\n\\nIs a cycle always 28 days?\\n\\nThe average cycle is 28 days but, for some women, it is as short as 21 days, for others it is as long as 35 days. When you first start having periods, it can also take a while before your periods develop a regular pattern. Your cycle also changes as you get older.\\n\\nYour menstruation cycle (and period) stops temporarily when you are pregnant. Breastfeeding also affects your cycle. At the end of menopause, your cycle stops permanently.\\n\\nWhat does a period feel like?\\n\\nSome women will have pain in their belly (the lower abdomen). This can be a crampy pain or just a mild ache. You may have lower backache on its own or with the pain in your belly. The pain can often be stronger on the first day or two of your period and will vary in strength and severity from one women to another. Some women also have a headache or feel very tired just before their period arrives or on the first day. Mood changes, teariness and easily losing your temper can sometimes be an indicator that you are getting your period, this is referred to as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual tension (PMT). For some women this can be so overwhelming that they are unable to go about their normal lives. Any symptoms that you find hard to manage should be investigated with your GP.\\n\\nMany women have no symptoms at all. It is not uncommon for women to notice that they have their period only after they have gone to the toilet and found that there is blood on their underpants or on their toilet paper.\\n\\nEven without overwhelming symptoms, some women still find it comforting to simply take time out when they get their period, and cuddle up with a hot water bottle.\\n\\nAdolescent girls and women can both experience skin changes and pimples with their periods.\\n\\nWhat to do when you get your period\\n\\nBefore you start getting periods it is good to be prepared for when it eventually comes. Hopefully you will have an opportunity to talk with your mother or sister or someone else in your family who can help you to prepare. Meanwhile here are some tips for when you do start bleeding.\\n\\nUse period products like a pad, tampon, menstrual cup or period underwear to absorb the bleeding. Pads and liners are longs strips of cotton that you stick to your underwear. Tampons are thin cylinders of dense cotton attached to a string that you put inside your vagina. Pads, liners and tampons come in different shapes and sizes. Pads should be changed every four to five hours to stop leakage. You can use a tampon whenever you want, you don't have to wait until you start having sex before a tampon will go in. It may be a little hard to get it in to begin with, but you will get used to it very quickly. Tampons should be changed every three to four hours. Menstrual cups should be changed about every eight hours and period underwear can be washed out at the end of the day.\\n\\nKeep a ‘period kit’ somewhere handy. This is because you might get your period unexpectedly or forget it’s due. Keeping some painkillers, period products and a spare pair of underpants in your bag, at school or at work can be a lifesaver.\\n\\nEnjoy life as much as possible. It’s safe and often possible to do all the things you would normally do. It’s also okay to have sex when you have your period, but if you’re using a tampon you’ll need to take it out first.\\n\\nIf you have period pain you can take painkillers that you can buy over the counter at the chemist. If your pain isn’t relieved with regular painkillers, visit your GP (your local doctor).\\n\\nRelated information\\n\\nProvide feedback about the information on this page.\\n\\nDisclaimer\\n\\nThe Women’s does not accept any liability to any person for the information or advice (or use of such information or advice) which is provided on the Website or incorporated into it by reference.

For the condition called male menopause, see Andropause. For the medical journal, see Menopause (journal).\\n\\nNot to be confused with mesopause.\\n\\nMedical condition\\n\\nMenopause Other names Climacteric  Specialty Gynecology Symptoms No menstrual periods for a year [ 1 ] Duration ~3 years Causes Usually a natural change. Can also be caused by surgery that removes both ovaries , and some types of chemotherapy . [ 1 ] Treatment None, lifestyle changes [ 2 ] Medication Menopausal hormone therapy , clonidine , gabapentin , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [ 2 ] [ 3 ]\\n\\nMenopause, also known as the climacteric, is the time when menstrual periods permanently stop, marking the end of the reproductive stage for the female human.[1][4][5] It typically occurs between the ages of 45 and 55, although the exact timing can vary.[6] Menopause is usually a natural change related to a decrease in circulating blood estrogen levels.[1] It can occur earlier in those who smoke tobacco.[1][7] Other causes include surgery that removes both ovaries, some types of chemotherapy, or anything that leads to a decrease in hormone levels.[8][1] At the physiological level, menopause happens because of a decrease in the ovaries\\' production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone.[1] While typically not needed, measuring hormone levels in the blood or urine can confirm a diagnosis.[9] Menopause is the opposite of menarche, the time when periods start.[10]\\n\\nIn the years before menopause, a woman\\'s periods typically become irregular,[11][12] which means that periods may be longer or shorter in duration, or be lighter or heavier in the amount of flow.[11] During this time, women often experience hot flashes; these typically last from 30 seconds to ten minutes and may be associated with shivering, night sweats, and reddening of the skin.[11] Hot flashes[11] can recur for four to five years.[4] Other symptoms may include vaginal dryness,[13] trouble sleeping, and mood changes.[11][14] The severity of symptoms varies between women.[4] Menopause before the age of 45 years is considered to be \"early menopause\", and when ovarian failure/surgical removal of the ovaries occurs before the age of 40 years this is termed \"premature ovarian insufficiency\".[15]\\n\\nIn addition to symptoms (hot flushes/flashes, night sweats, mood changes, arthralgia and vaginal dryness), the physical consequences of menopause include bone loss, increased central abdominal fat, and adverse changes in a woman\\'s cholesterol profile and vascular function.[15] These changes predispose postmenopausal women to increased risks of osteoporosis and bone fracture, and of cardio-metabolic disease (diabetes and cardiovascular disease).[15]\\n\\nMedical professionals often define menopause as having occurred when a woman has not had any menstrual bleeding for a year.[1] It may also be defined by a decrease in hormone production by the ovaries.[16] In those who have had surgery to remove their uterus but still have functioning ovaries, menopause is not considered to have yet occurred.[15] Following the removal of the uterus, symptoms of menopause typically occur earlier.[17] Iatrogenic menopause occurs when both ovaries are surgically removed (Oophorectomy) along with the uterus for medical reasons.\\n\\nMedical treatment of menopause is primarily to ameliorate symptoms and prevent bone loss.[18] Mild symptoms may be improved with treatment. With respect to hot flashes, avoiding nicotine, caffeine, and alcohol is often recommended; sleeping naked in a cool room and using a fan may help. The most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT).[13][18] Non-hormonal therapies for hot flashes include cognitive-behavioral therapy, clinical hypnosis, gabapentin, fezolinetant or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.[19][20] These will not improve symptoms such as joint pain or vaginal dryness, which affect over 55% of women.[18] Exercise may help with sleeping problems. Many of the concerns about the use of MHT raised by older studies are no longer considered barriers to MHT in healthy women.[18] High-quality evidence for the effectiveness of alternative medicine has not been found.[4]\\n\\nSigns and symptoms\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDuring early menopause transition, the menstrual cycles remain regular but the interval between cycles begins to lengthen. Hormone levels begin to fluctuate. Ovulation may not occur with each cycle.[21]\\n\\nThe term menopause refers to a point in time that follows one year after the last menstruation.[21] During the menopausal transition and after menopause, women can experience a wide range of symptoms.[11] However, for women who enter the menopause transition without having regular menstrual cycles (due to prior surgery, other medical conditions or ongoing hormonal contraception) the menopause cannot be identified by bleeding patterns and is defined as the permanent loss of ovarian function.[18]\\n\\nVagina, uterus and bladder (urogenital tract)\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDuring the transition to menopause, menstrual patterns can show shorter cycling (by 2–7 days);[21] longer cycles remain possible.[21] There may be irregular bleeding (lighter, heavier, spotting).[11][21] Dysfunctional uterine bleeding is often experienced by women approaching menopause due to the hormonal changes that accompany the menopause transition. Spotting or bleeding may simply be related to vaginal atrophy, a benign sore (polyp or lesion), or may be a functional endometrial response. The European Menopause and Andropause Society has released guidelines for assessment of the endometrium, which is usually the main source of spotting or bleeding.[22]\\n\\nIn post-menopausal women, however, any unscheduled vaginal bleeding is of concern and requires an appropriate investigation to rule out the possibility of malignant diseases.\\n\\nUrogenital symptoms may appear during menopause and continue through postmenopause and include painful intercourse, vaginal dryness and atrophic vaginitis (thinning of the membranes of the vulva, the vagina, the cervix and the outer urinary tract). There may also be considerable shrinking and loss in elasticity of all of the outer and inner genital areas. Urinary urgency may also occur and urinary incontinence in some women.[21][23]\\n\\nOther physical effects\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe most common physical symptoms of menopause are heavy night sweats, and hot flashes (also known as vasomotor symptoms).[24] Sleeping problems and insomnia are also common.[25] Other physical symptoms may be reported that are not specific to menopause but may be exacerbated by it, such as lack of energy, joint soreness, stiffness, back pain, breast enlargement, breast pain, heart palpitations, headache, dizziness, dry, itchy skin, thinning, tingling skin, rosacea, weight gain.[21][26]\\n\\nMood and memory effects\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nPsychological symptoms are often reported but they are not specific to menopause and can be caused by other factors.[27][28] They include anxiety, poor memory, inability to concentrate, depressive mood, irritability, mood swings, and less interest in sexual activity.[21][29][11]\\n\\nMenopause-related cognitive impairment can be confused with the mild cognitive impairment that precedes dementia.[30] There is evidence of small decreases in verbal memory, on average, which may be caused by the effects of declining estrogen levels on the brain,[31] or perhaps by reduced blood flow to the brain during hot flashes.[32] However, these tend to resolve for most women during the postmenopause. Subjective reports of memory and concentration problems are associated with several factors, such as lack of sleep, and stress.[28][27]\\n\\nLong-term effects\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCardiovascular health\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nExposure to endogenous estrogen during reproductive years provides women with protection against cardiovascular disease, which is lost around 10 years after the onset of menopause. The menopausal transition is associated with an increase in fat mass (predominantly in visceral fat), an increase in insulin resistance, dyslipidaemia, and endothelial dysfunction.[33] Women with vasomotor symptoms during menopause seem to have an especially unfavorable cardiometabolic profile,[34] as well as women with premature onset of menopause (before 45 years of age).[35] These risks can be reduced by managing risk factors, such as tobacco smoking, hypertension, increased blood lipids and body weight.[36][37]\\n\\nBone health\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe annual rates of bone mineral density loss are highest starting one year before the final menstrual period and continuing through the two years after it.[38] Thus, post menopausal women are at increased risk of osteopenia, osteoporosis and fractures.\\n\\nCauses\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMenopause is a normal event in a woman\\'s life and a natural part of aging.[23] Menopause can also be induced early.[39] Induced menopause occurs as a result of medical treatment such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, oophorectomy, or complications of tubal ligation, hysterectomy, unilateral or bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or leuprorelin usage.[40]\\n\\nAge\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMenopause typically occurs at some point between 47 and 54 years of age.[6] According to various data, more than 95% of women have their last period between the ages of 44–56 (median 49–50). 2% of women under the age of 40, 5% between the ages of 40–45 and the same number between the ages of 55–58 have their last bleeding.[41] The average age of the last period in the United States is 51 years, in Russia is 50 years, in Greece is 49 years, in Turkey is 47 years, in Egypt is 47 years and in India is 46 years.[42] Beyond the influence of genetics, these differences are also due to early-life environmental conditions[43] and associated with epigenetic effects.[44] The menopausal transition or perimenopause leading up to menopause usually lasts 3–4 years (sometimes as long as 5–14 years).[1][12]\\n\\nUndiagnosed and untreated coeliac disease is a risk factor for early menopause. Coeliac disease can present with several non-gastrointestinal symptoms, in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms, and most cases escape timely recognition and go undiagnosed, leading to a risk of long-term complications. A strict gluten-free diet reduces the risk. Women with early diagnosis and treatment of coeliac disease present a normal duration of fertile life span.[45][46]\\n\\nWomen who have undergone hysterectomy with ovary conservation go through menopause on average 1.5 years earlier than the expected age.[18]\\n\\nPremature ovarian insufficiency\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn rare cases, a woman\\'s ovaries stop working at a very early age, ranging anywhere from the age of puberty to age 40. This is known as premature ovarian failure or premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) and affects 1 to 2% of women by age 40.[47][48][49] It is diagnosed or confirmed by high blood levels of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) on at least three occasions at least four weeks apart.[50]\\n\\nPremature ovarian insufficiency may be related to an auto immune disorder and therefore might co-occur with other autoimmune disorders such as thyroid disease, [adrenal insufficiency], and diabetes mellitus.[49] Other causes include chemotherapy, being a carrier of the fragile X syndrome gene, and radiotherapy.[49] However, in about 50–80% of cases of premature ovarian insufficiency, the cause is unknown, i.e., it is generally idiopathic.[48][50]\\n\\nEarly menopause can be related to cigarette smoking, higher body mass index, racial and ethnic factors, illnesses, and the removal of the uterus.[51]\\n\\nSurgical menopause\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMenopause can be surgically induced by bilateral oophorectomy (removal of ovaries),[39] which is often, but not always, done in conjunction with removal of the fallopian tubes (salpingo-oophorectomy) and uterus (hysterectomy).[52] Cessation of menses as a result of removal of the ovaries is called \"surgical menopause\". Surgical treatments, such as the removal of ovaries, might cause periods to stop altogether.[53] The sudden and complete drop in hormone levels may produce extreme withdrawal symptoms such as hot flashes, etc. The symptoms of early menopause may be more severe.[53]\\n\\nRemoval of the uterus without removal of the ovaries does not directly cause menopause, although pelvic surgery of this type can often precipitate a somewhat earlier menopause, perhaps because of a compromised blood supply to the ovaries.[medical citation needed] The time between surgery and possible early menopause is due to the fact that ovaries are still producing hormones.[53]\\n\\nMechanism\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe menopausal transition, and postmenopause itself, is a natural change, not usually a disease state or a disorder. The main cause of this transition is the natural depletion and aging of the finite amount of oocytes (ovarian reserve). This process is sometimes accelerated by other conditions and is known to occur earlier after a wide range of gynecologic procedures such as hysterectomy (with and without ovariectomy), endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolisation. The depletion of the ovarian reserve causes an increase in circulating follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) levels because there are fewer oocytes and follicles responding to these hormones and producing estrogen.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe transition has a variable degree of effects.[54]\\n\\nThe stages of the menopause transition have been classified according to a woman\\'s reported bleeding pattern, supported by changes in the pituitary follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels.[55]\\n\\nIn younger women, during a normal menstrual cycle the ovaries produce estradiol, testosterone and progesterone in a cyclical pattern under the control of FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are both produced by the pituitary gland. During perimenopause (approaching menopause), estradiol levels and patterns of production remain relatively unchanged or may increase compared to young women, but the cycles become frequently shorter or irregular.[56] The often observed increase in estrogen is presumed to be in response to elevated FSH levels that, in turn, is hypothesized to be caused by decreased feedback by inhibin.[57] Similarly, decreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause.[58][59]\\n\\nThe menopausal transition is characterized by marked, and often dramatic, variations in FSH and estradiol levels. Because of this, measurements of these hormones are not considered to be reliable guides to a woman\\'s exact menopausal status.[57]\\n\\nMenopause occurs because of the sharp decrease of estradiol and progesterone production by the ovaries. After menopause, estrogen continues to be produced mostly by aromatase in fat tissues and is produced in small amounts in many other tissues such as ovaries, bone, blood vessels, and the brain where it acts locally.[60] The substantial fall in circulating estradiol levels at menopause impacts many tissues, from brain to skin.\\n\\nIn contrast to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels has not been observed.[61] Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.[62]\\n\\nHot flashes and other vasomotor and body symptoms accompanying the menopausal transition are associated with estrogen insufficiency and changes that occur in the brain, primarily the hypothalamus and involve complex interplay between the neurotransmitters kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin, which are found in KNDy neurons in the infundibular nucleus.[63]\\n\\nOvarian aging\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDecreased inhibin feedback after hysterectomy is hypothesized to contribute to increased ovarian stimulation and earlier menopause. Hastened ovarian aging has been observed after endometrial ablation. While it is difficult to prove that these surgeries are causative, it has been hypothesized that the endometrium may be producing endocrine factors contributing to the endocrine feedback and regulation of the ovarian stimulation. Elimination of these factors contributes to faster depletion of the ovarian reserve. Reduced blood supply to the ovaries that may occur as a consequence of hysterectomy and uterine artery embolisation has been hypothesized to contribute to this effect.[58][59]\\n\\nImpaired DNA repair mechanisms may contribute to earlier depletion of the ovarian reserve during aging.[64] As women age, double-strand breaks accumulate in the DNA of their primordial follicles. Primordial follicles are immature primary oocytes surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells. An enzyme system is present in oocytes that ordinarily accurately repairs DNA double-strand breaks. This repair system is called \"homologous recombinational repair\", and it is especially effective during meiosis. Meiosis is the general process by which germ cells are formed in all sexual eukaryotes; it appears to be an adaptation for efficiently removing damages in germ line DNA.[65]\\n\\nHuman primary oocytes are present at an intermediate stage of meiosis, termed prophase I (see Oogenesis). Expression of four key DNA repair genes that are necessary for homologous recombinational repair during meiosis (BRCA1, MRE11, Rad51, and ATM) decline with age in oocytes.[64] This age-related decline in ability to repair DNA double-strand damages can account for the accumulation of these damages, that then likely contributes to the depletion of the ovarian reserve.\\n\\nDiagnosis\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nWays of assessing the impact on women of some of these menopause effects, include the Greene climacteric scale questionnaire,[66] the Cervantes scale[67] and the Menopause rating scale.[68]\\n\\nPerimenopause\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe term \"perimenopause\", which literally means \"around the menopause\", refers to the menopause transition years before the date of the final episode of flow.[1][12][69][70] According to the North American Menopause Society, this transition can last for four to eight years.[71] The Centre for Menstrual Cycle and Ovulation Research describes it as a six- to ten-year phase ending 12 months after the last menstrual period.[72]\\n\\nDuring perimenopause, estrogen levels average about 20–30% higher than during premenopause, often with wide fluctuations.[72] These fluctuations cause many of the physical changes during perimenopause as well as menopause, especially during the last 1–2 years of perimenopause (before menopause).[69][73] Some of these changes are hot flashes, night sweats, difficulty sleeping, mood swings, vaginal dryness or atrophy, incontinence, osteoporosis, and heart disease.[72] Perimenopause is also associated with a higher likelihood of depression (affecting from 45 percent to 68 percent of perimenopausal women), which is twice as likely to affect those with a history of depression.[74]\\n\\nDuring this period, fertility diminishes but is not considered to reach zero until the official date of menopause. The official date is determined retroactively, once 12 months have passed after the last appearance of menstrual blood.\\n\\nThe menopause transition typically begins between 40 and 50 years of age (average 47.5).[75][76] The duration of perimenopause may be for up to eight years.[76] Women will often, but not always, start these transitions (perimenopause and menopause) about the same time as their mother did.[77]\\n\\nSome research appears to show that melatonin supplementation in perimenopausal women can improve thyroid function and gonadotropin levels, as well as restoring fertility and menstruation and preventing depression associated with menopause.[78]\\n\\nPostmenopause\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe term \"postmenopausal\" describes women who have not experienced any menstrual flow for a minimum of 12 months, assuming that they have a uterus and are not pregnant or lactating.[52] The reason for this delay in declaring postmenopause is that periods are usually erratic during menopause. Therefore, a reasonably long stretch of time is necessary to be sure that the cycling has ceased. At this point a woman is considered infertile; however, the possibility of becoming pregnant has usually been very low (but not quite zero) for a number of years before this point is reached.[citation needed]\\n\\nIn women with or without a uterus, menopause or postmenopause can also be identified by a blood test showing a very high follicle-stimulating hormone level, greater than 25 IU/L in a random blood draw; it rises as ovaries become inactive.[52] FSH continues to rise, as its counterpart estradiol continues to drop for about 2 years after the last menstrual period, after which the levels of each of these hormones stabilize. The stabilization period after the begin of early postmenopause has been estimated to last 3 to 6 years, so early postmenopause lasts altogether about 5 to 8 years, during which hormone withdrawal effects such as hot flashes disappear.[52] Finally, late postmenopause has been defined as the remainder of a woman s lifespan, when reproductive hormones do not change any more.[citation needed]\\n\\nA period-like flow during postmenopause, even spotting, may be a sign of endometrial cancer.\\n\\nManagement\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nPerimenopause is a natural stage of life. It is not a disease or a disorder. Therefore, it does not automatically require any kind of medical treatment. However, in those cases where the physical, mental, and emotional effects of perimenopause are strong enough that they significantly disrupt the life of the woman experiencing them, palliative medical therapy may sometimes be appropriate.\\n\\nMenopausal hormone therapy\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Hormone replacement therapy\\n\\nIn the context of the menopause, menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the use of estrogen in women without a uterus and estrogen plus progestogen in women who have an intact uterus.[79]\\n\\nMHT may be reasonable for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes.[80] It is the most effective treatment option, especially when delivered as a skin patch.[81][82] Its use, however, appears to increase the risk of strokes and blood clots.[83] When used for menopausal symptoms the global recommendation is MHT should be prescribed for a long as there are defined treatment effects and goals for the individual woman.[18]\\n\\nMHT is also effective for preventing bone loss and osteoporotic fracture,[84] but it is generally recommended only for women at significant risk for whom other therapies are unsuitable.[85]\\n\\nMHT may be unsuitable for some women, including those at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, increased risk of thromboembolic disease (such as those with obesity or a history of venous thrombosis) or increased risk of some types of cancer.[85] There is some concern that this treatment increases the risk of breast cancer.[86] Women at increased risk of cardiometabolic disease and VTE may be able to use transdermal estradiol which does not appear to increase risks in low to moderate doses.[18]\\n\\nAdding testosterone to hormone therapy has a positive effect on sexual function in postmenopausal women, although it may be accompanied by hair growth or acne if used in excess. Transdermal testosterone therapy in appropriate dosing is generally safe.[87]\\n\\nSelective estrogen receptor modulators\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSERMs are a category of drugs, either synthetically produced or derived from a botanical source, that act selectively as agonists or antagonists on the estrogen receptors throughout the body. The most commonly prescribed SERMs are raloxifene and tamoxifen. Raloxifene exhibits oestrogen agonist activity on bone and lipids, and antagonist activity on breast and the endometrium.[88] Tamoxifen is in widespread use for treatment of hormone sensitive breast cancer. Raloxifene prevents vertebral fractures in postmenopausal, osteoporotic women and reduces the risk of invasive breast cancer.[89]\\n\\nOther medications\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSome of the SSRIs and SNRIs appear to provide some relief from vasomotor symptoms.[20][19] The most effective SSRIs and SNRIs are paroxetine, escitalopram, citalopram, venlafaxine, and desvenlafaxine.[19] They may, however, be associated with appetite and sleeping problems, constipation and nausea.[20][90]\\n\\nGabapentin or fezolinetant can also improve the frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms.[20][19] Side effects of using gabapentin include drowsiness and headaches.[20][90]\\n\\nTherapy\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCognitive behavioural therapy and clinical hypnosis can decrease the amount women are affected by hot flashes.[19] Mindfulness is not yet proven to be effective in easing vasomotor symptoms.[91][92][19]\\n\\nLifestyle and exercise\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nExercise has been thought to reduce postmenopausal symptoms through the increase of endorphin levels, which decrease as estrogen production decreases.[93] However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that exercise helps with the symptoms of menopause.[19] Similarly, yoga has not been shown to be useful as a treatment for vasomotor symptoms.[19]\\n\\nHowever a high BMI is a risk factor for vasomotor symptoms in particular. Weight loss may help with symptom management.[94][19]\\n\\nThere is no strong evidence that cooling techniques such as using specific clothing or environment control tools (for example fans) help with symptoms.[19] Paced breathing and relaxation are not effective in easing symptoms.[19]\\n\\nDietary supplements\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThere is no evidence of consistent benefit of taking any dietary supplements or herbal products for menopausal symptoms.[19][95][96] These widely marketed but ineffective supplements include soy isoflavones, pollen extracts, black cohosh, omega-3 among many others.[19][97][98]\\n\\nAlternative medicine\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThere is no evidence of consistent benefit of alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms despite their popularity.[96][19]\\n\\nAs of 2023, there is no evidence to support the efficacy of acupuncture as a management for menopausal symptoms.[19][99][96] The Cochrane review found not enough evidence in 2016 to show a difference between Chinese herbal medicine and placebo for the vasomotor symptoms.[100]\\n\\nOther efforts\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nLack of lubrication is a common problem during and after perimenopause. Vaginal moisturizers can help women with overall dryness, and lubricants can help with lubrication difficulties that may be present during intercourse. It is worth pointing out that moisturizers and lubricants are different products for different issues: some women complain that their genitalia are uncomfortably dry all the time, and they may do better with moisturizers. Those who need only lubricants do well using them only during intercourse.\\n\\nLow-dose prescription vaginal estrogen products such as estrogen creams are generally a safe way to use estrogen topically, to help vaginal thinning and dryness problems (see vaginal atrophy) while only minimally increasing the levels of estrogen in the bloodstream.\\n\\nIndividual counseling or support groups can sometimes be helpful to handle sad, depressed, anxious or confused feelings women may be having as they pass through what can be for some a very challenging transition time.\\n\\nOsteoporosis can be minimized by smoking cessation, adequate vitamin D intake and regular weight-bearing exercise. The bisphosphonate drug alendronate may decrease the risk of a fracture, in women that have both bone loss and a previous fracture and less so for those with just osteoporosis.[101]\\n\\nA surgical procedure where a part of one of the ovaries is removed earlier in life and frozen and then over time thawed and returned to the body (ovarian tissue cryopreservation) has been tried. While at least 11 women have undergone the procedure and paid over £6,000, there is no evidence it is safe or effective.[102]\\n\\nSociety and culture\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAttitudes and experiences\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe menopause transition is a process, involving hormonal, menstrual, and typically vasomotor changes. However, the experience of the menopause as a whole is very much influenced by psychological and social factors, such as past experience, lifestyle, social and cultural meanings of menopause, and a woman\\'s social and material circumstances. Menopause has been described as a biopsychosocial experience, with social and cultural factors playing a prominent role in the way menopause is experienced and perceived.[citation needed]\\n\\nThe paradigm within which a woman considers menopause influences the way she views it: women who understand menopause as a medical condition rate it significantly more negatively than those who view it as a life transition or a symbol of aging.[103] There is some evidence that negative attitudes and expectations, held before the menopause, predict symptom experience during the menopause,[104] and beliefs and attitudes toward menopause tend to be more positive in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women.[105] Women with more negative attitudes towards the menopause report more symptoms during this transition.[104]\\n\\nMenopause is a stage of life experienced in different ways. It can be characterized by personal challenges, changes in personal roles within the family and society. Women\\'s approaches to changes during menopause are influenced by their personal, family and sociocultural background.[106] Women from different regions and countries also have different attitudes. Postmenopausal women had more positive attitudes toward menopause compared with peri- or premenopausal women. Other influencing factors of attitudes toward menopause include age, menopausal symptoms, psychological and socioeconomical status, and profession and ethnicity.[107]\\n\\nEthnicity and geography play roles in the experience of menopause. American women of different ethnicities report significantly different types of menopausal effects. One major study found Caucasian women most likely to report what are sometimes described as psychosomatic symptoms, while African-American women were more likely to report vasomotor symptoms.[108]\\n\\nThere may be variations in experiences of women from different ethnic backgrounds regarding menopause and care. Immigrant women reported more vasomotor symptoms and other physical symptoms and poorer mental health than non-immigrant women and were mostly dissatisfied with the care they had received. Self-management strategies for menopausal symptoms were also influenced by culture.[109]\\n\\nTwo multinational studies of Asian women, found that hot flushes were not the most commonly reported symptoms, instead body and joint aches, memory problems, sleeplessness, irritability and migraines were.[110] In another study comparing experiences of menopause amongst White Australian women and women in Laos, Australian women reported higher rates of depression, as well as fears of aging, weight gain and cancer – fears not reported by Laotian women, who positioned menopause as a positive event.[111] Japanese women experience menopause effects, or kōnenki (更年期), in a different way from American women.[112] Japanese women report lower rates of hot flashes and night sweats; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, both biological and social. Historically, kōnenki was associated with wealthy middle-class housewives in Japan, i.e., it was a \"luxury disease\" that women from traditional, inter-generational rural households did not report. Menopause in Japan was viewed as a symptom of the inevitable process of aging, rather than a \"revolutionary transition\", or a \"deficiency disease\" in need of management.[112] As of 2005, in Japanese culture, reporting of vasomotor symptoms has been on the increase, with research finding that of 140 Japanese participants, hot flashes were prevalent in 22.1%.[113] This was almost double that of 20 years prior.[114] Whilst the exact cause for this is unknown, possible contributing factors include dietary changes, increased medicalisation of middle-aged women and increased media attention on the subject.[114] However, reporting of vasomotor symptoms is still \"significantly\" lower than in North America.[115]\\n\\nAdditionally, while most women in the United States apparently have a negative view of menopause as a time of deterioration or decline, some studies seem to indicate that women from some Asian cultures have an understanding of menopause that focuses on a sense of liberation and celebrates the freedom from the risk of pregnancy.[116] Diverging from these conclusions, one study appeared to show that many American women \"experience this time as one of liberation and self-actualization\".[117]\\n\\nIn some women, menopause may bring about a sense of loss related to the end of fertility. In addition, this change often aligns with other stressors, such as the responsibility of looking after elderly parents or dealing with the emotional challenges of \"empty nest syndrome\" when children move out of the family home. This situation can be accentuated in cultures where being older is negatively perceived.\\n\\nImpact on work\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: Menopause in the workplace\\n\\nMidlife is typically a life stage when men and women may be dealing with demanding life events and responsibilities, such as work, health problems, and caring roles. For example, in 2018 in the UK women aged 45–54 report more work-related stress than men or women of any other age group.[118] Hot flashes are often reported to be particularly distressing at work and lead to embarrassment and worry about potential stigmatisation.[119] A June 2023 study by the Mayo Clinic estimated an annual loss of $1.8 billion in the United States due to workdays missed as a result of menopause symptoms.[120] This was one of the largest studies to date examining the impact of menopause symptoms on work outcomes. The research concluded there was a strong need to improve medical treatment for menopausal women and make the workplace environment more supportive to avoid such productivity losses.\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMenopause literally means the \"end of monthly cycles\" (the end of monthly periods or menstruation), from the Greek word pausis (\"pause\") and mēn (\"month\"). This is a medical coinage; the Greek word for menses is actually different. In Ancient Greek, the menses were described in the plural, ta emmēnia (\"the monthlies\"), and its modern descendant has been clipped to ta emmēna. The Modern Greek medical term is emmenopausis in Katharevousa or emmenopausi in Demotic Greek. The Ancient Greeks did not produce medical concepts about any symptoms associated with end of menstruation and did not use a specific word to refer to this time of a woman\\'s life. The word menopause was invented by French doctors at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Greek etymology was reconstructed at this time and it was the Parisian student doctor Charles-Pierre-Louis de Gardanne who invented a variation of the word in 1812, which was edited to its final French form in 1821.[121]\\n\\nSome of them noted that peasant women had no complaints about the end of menses, while urban middle-class women had many troubling symptoms. Doctors at this time considered the symptoms to be the result of urban lifestyles of sedentary behaviour, alcohol consumption, too much time indoors, and over-eating, with a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables.[122]\\n\\nThe word \"menopause\" was coined specifically for female humans, where the end of fertility is traditionally indicated by the permanent stopping of monthly menstruations. However, menopause exists in some other animals, many of which do not have monthly menstruation;[123] in this case, the term means a natural end to fertility that occurs before the end of the natural lifespan.\\n\\nIn popular culture, law and politics\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nIn the 21st century, celebrities have spoken out about their experiences of the menopause, which has led to it becoming less of a taboo as it has boosted awareness of the debilitating symptoms. Subsequently, TV shows have been running features on the menopause to help women experiencing symptoms. In the UK Lorraine Kelly has been an advocate for getting women to speak about their experiences including sharing her own. This has led to an increase in women seeking treatment such as HRT.[124] Davina McCall also led an awareness campaign based on a documentary on Channel 4.[125]\\n\\nIn the UK, Carolyn Harris sponsored the Menopause (Support and Services) Bill in June 2021. It was to exempt hormone replacement therapy from National Health Service prescription charges and to make provisions about menopause support and services, including public education and communication in supporting perimenopausal and post-menopausal women, and to raise awareness of menopause and its effects. The bill was withdrawn on 29 October 2021.[126]\\n\\nIn the US, David McKinley, Republican from West Virginia introduced the Menopause Research Act in September 2022 for $100 million in 2023 and 2024, but it stalled.[127]\\n\\nOther animals\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nThe majority of mammal species reach menopause when they cease the production of ovarian follicles, which contain eggs (oocytes), between one-third and two-thirds of their maximum possible lifespan.[128] However, few live long enough in the wild to reach this point. Humans are joined by a limited number of other species in which females live substantially longer than their ability to reproduce. Examples of others include cetaceans: beluga whales,[129] narwhals,[129] orcas,[130] false killer whales[131] and short-finned pilot whales.[132]\\n\\nMenopause has been reported in a variety of other vertebrate species, but these examples tend to be from captive individuals, and thus are not necessarily representative of what happens in natural populations in the wild. Menopause in captivity has been observed in several species of nonhuman primates,[123] including rhesus monkeys[133] and chimpanzees.[134] Some research suggests that wild chimpanzees do not experience menopause, as their fertility declines are associated with declines in overall health.[135] Menopause has been reported in elephants in captivity[136] and guppies.[137] Dogs do not experience menopause; the canine estrus cycle simply becomes irregular and infrequent. Although older female dogs are not considered good candidates for breeding, offspring have been produced by older animals, see Canine reproduction. Similar observations have been made in cats.[138]\\n\\nLife histories show a varying degree of senescence; rapid senescing organisms (e.g., Pacific salmon and annual plants) do not have a post-reproductive life-stage. Gradual senescence is exhibited by all placental mammalian life histories.[original research?]\\n\\nEvolution\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Evolution of menopause\\n\\nThere are various theories on the origin and process of the evolution of the menopause. These attempt to suggest evolutionary benefits to the human species stemming from the cessation of women\\'s reproductive capability before the end of their natural lifespan. It is conjectured that in highly social groups natural selection favors females that stop reproducing and devote that post-reproductive life span to continuing to care for existing offspring, both their own and those of others to whom they are related, especially their granddaughters and grandsons.[139]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nEuropean Menopause and Andropause Society\\n\\nMenopause in the workplace\\n\\nMenopause in incarceration\\n\\nPregnancy over age 50\\n\\nBiological clock\\n\\nEvolution of menopause\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ a b c d e f g h i j \"Menopause Basics\".

Ovulation marks the end of the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle , and the start of the luteal phase . Identifiers MeSH D010060 TE E1.0.0.0.0.0.7 Anatomical terminology [ edit on Wikidata ]\\n\\nOvulation is an important part of the menstrual cycle in female vertebrates where the egg cells are released from the ovaries as part of the ovarian cycle. In female humans ovulation typically occurs near the midpoint in the menstrual cycle and after the follicular phase. Ovulation is stimulated by an increase in luteinizing hormone (LH). The ovarian follicles rupture and release the secondary oocyte ovarian cells.[1]\\n\\nAfter ovulation, during the luteal phase, the egg will be available to be fertilized by sperm. If it is not, it will break down in less than a day. Meanwhile, the uterine lining (endometrium) continues to thicken to be able to receive a fertilized egg. If no conception occurs, the uterine lining will eventually break down and be shed from the body via the vagina during menstruation.[2]\\n\\nSome people choose to track ovulation in order to improve or aid becoming pregnant by timing intercourse with their ovulation.[3] The signs of ovulation may include cervical mucus changes, mild cramping in the abdominal area, and a small rise in basal body temperature. Medication is also sometimes required by those experiencing infertility to induce ovulation.[3]\\n\\nProcess\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nOvulation occurs about midway through the menstrual cycle, after the follicular phase. The days in which a woman is most fertile can be calculated based on the date of the last menstrual period and the length of a typical menstrual cycle.[4] The few days surrounding ovulation (from approximately days 10 to 18 of a 28-day cycle), constitute the most fertile phase.[5][6][7][8] The time from the beginning of the last menstrual period (LMP) until ovulation is, on average, 14.6 days, but with substantial variation among females and between cycles in any single female, with an overall 95% prediction interval of 8.2 to 20.5 days.[9]\\n\\nThe process of ovulation is controlled by the hypothalamus of the brain and through the release of hormones secreted in the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH).[10] In the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, the ovarian follicle will undergo a series of transformations called cumulus expansion, which is stimulated by FSH. After this is done, a hole called the stigma will form in the follicle, and the secondary oocyte will leave the follicle through this hole. Ovulation is triggered by a spike in the amount of FSH and LH released from the pituitary gland. During the luteal (post-ovulatory) phase, the secondary oocyte will travel through the fallopian tubes toward the uterus. If fertilized by a sperm, the fertilized secondary oocyte or ovum may implant there 6–12 days later.[11]\\n\\nFollicular phase\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nSee also: Folliculogenesis\\n\\nThe follicular phase (or proliferative phase) is the phase of the menstrual cycle during which the ovarian follicles mature. The follicular phase lasts from the beginning of menstruation to the start of ovulation.[12][13]\\n\\nFor ovulation to be successful, the ovum must be supported by the corona radiata and cumulus oophorous granulosa cells.[14] The latter undergo a period of proliferation and mucification known as cumulus expansion. Mucification is the secretion of a hyaluronic acid-rich cocktail that disperses and gathers the cumulus cell network in a sticky matrix around the ovum. This network stays with the ovum after ovulation and has been shown to be necessary for fertilization.[15][16]\\n\\nOvulation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nEstrogen levels peak towards the end of the follicular phase, around 12 and 24 hours. This, by positive feedback, causes a surge in levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). This lasts from 24 to 36 hours, and results in the rupture of the ovarian follicles, causing the oocyte to be released from the ovary.[17]\\n\\nThrough a signal transduction cascade initiated by LH, which activates the pro-inflammatory genes through cAMP secondary messenger, proteolytic enzymes are secreted by the follicle that degrade the follicular tissue at the site of the blister, forming a hole called the stigma. The secondary oocyte leaves the ruptured follicle and moves out into the peritoneal cavity through the stigma, where it is caught by the fimbriae at the end of the fallopian tube. After entering the fallopian tube, the oocyte is pushed along by cilia, beginning its journey toward the uterus.[10]\\n\\nBy this time, the oocyte has completed meiosis I, yielding two cells: the larger secondary oocyte that contains all of the cytoplasmic material and a smaller, inactive first polar body. Meiosis II follows at once but will be arrested in the metaphase and will so remain until fertilization. The spindle apparatus of the second meiotic division appears at the time of ovulation. If no fertilization occurs, the oocyte will degenerate between 12 and 24 hours after ovulation.[18] Approximately 1–2% of ovulations release more than one oocyte. This tendency increases with maternal age. Fertilization of two different oocytes by two different spermatozoa results in fraternal twins.[10]\\n\\nThe precise moment of ovulation was captured on film for the first time in 2008, coincidentally, during a routine hysterectomy procedure. According to the attending gynecologist, the ovum\\'s emergence and subsequent release from the ovarian follicle occurred within a 15-minute timeframe. [19]\\n\\nLuteal phase\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Luteal phase\\n\\nThe follicle proper has met the end of its lifespan. Without the oocyte, the follicle folds inward on itself, transforming into the corpus luteum (pl. corpora lutea), a steroidogenic cluster of cells that produces estrogen and progesterone. These hormones induce the endometrial glands to begin production of the proliferative endometrium and later into secretory endometrium, the site of embryonic growth if implantation occurs. The action of progesterone increases basal body temperature by one-quarter to one-half degree Celsius (one-half to one degree Fahrenheit). The corpus luteum continues this paracrine action for the remainder of the menstrual cycle, maintaining the endometrium, before disintegrating into scar tissue during menses.[20]\\n\\nClinical presentation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nFurther information: Concealed ovulation, Fertility awareness, and Mittelschmerz\\n\\nThe start of ovulation may be detected by signs that are not readily discernible other than to the ovulating female herself, thus humans are said to have a concealed ovulation.[21] In many animal species there are distinctive signals indicating the period when the female is fertile. Several explanations have been proposed to explain concealed ovulation in humans.\\n\\nFemales near ovulation experience changes in the cervical mucus, and in basal body temperature. Furthermore, many females experience secondary fertility signs including Mittelschmerz (pain associated with ovulation) and a heightened sense of smell, and can sense the precise moment of ovulation.[22][23] However, midcycle pain may also not be due to Mittelschmerz, but due to other factors such as cysts, endometriosis, sexually transmitted infections, or an ectopic pregnancy.[24] Other possible signs of ovulation include tender breasts, bloating, and cramps, although these symptoms are not a guarantee that ovulation is taking place.[25][26]\\n\\nMany females experience heightened sexual desire in the several days immediately before ovulation.[27] One study concluded that females subtly improve their facial attractiveness during ovulation.[28]\\n\\nSymptoms related to the onset of ovulation, the moment of ovulation and the body\\'s process of beginning and ending the menstrual cycle vary in intensity with each female but are fundamentally the same. The charting of such symptoms — primarily basal body temperature, mittelschmerz and cervical position — is referred to as the sympto-thermal method of fertility awareness, which allow auto-diagnosis by a female of her state of ovulation. Once training has been given by a suitable authority, fertility charts can be completed on a cycle-by-cycle basis to show ovulation. This gives the possibility of using the data to predict fertility for natural contraception and pregnancy planning.\\n\\nUrine levels of the hormone pregnanediol 3-glucuronide of over 5 μg/mL has been used to confirm ovulation. This test has a 100% specificity over 107 women.[30]\\n\\nDisorders\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nDisorders of ovulation, also known as ovulatory disorders are classified as menstrual disorders and include oligoovulation (infrequent or irregular ovulation) and anovulation (absence of ovulation):[31]\\n\\nOligoovulation is infrequent or irregular ovulation (usually defined as cycles of greater than 36 days or fewer than 8 cycles a year)\\n\\nAnovulation is absence of ovulation when it would be normally expected (in a post-menarchal, premenopausal female). Anovulation usually manifests itself as irregularity of menstrual periods, that is, unpredictable variability of intervals, duration, or bleeding. Anovulation can also cause cessation of periods (secondary amenorrhea) or excessive bleeding (dysfunctional uterine bleeding).\\n\\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the following classification of ovulatory disorders:[32]\\n\\nWHO group I: Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis failure\\n\\nWHO group II: Hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis dysfunction. WHO group II is the most common cause of ovulatory disorders, and the most common causative member is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).[33]\\n\\nWHO group III: Ovarian failure\\n\\nWHO group IV: Hyperprolactinemia\\n\\nMenstrual disorders can often indicate ovulatory disorder.[34]\\n\\nOvulation induction\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMain article: Ovulation induction\\n\\nOvulation induction is a promising assisted reproductive technology for patients with conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and oligomenorrhea. It is also used in in vitro fertilization to make the follicles mature before egg retrieval. Usually, ovarian stimulation is used in conjunction with ovulation induction to stimulate the formation of multiple oocytes.[35] Some sources[35] include ovulation induction in the definition of ovarian stimulation.\\n\\nA low dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) may be injected after completed ovarian stimulation. Ovulation will occur between 24 and 36 hours after the HCG injection.[35]\\n\\nBy contrast, induced ovulation in some animal species occurs naturally, ovulation can be stimulated by coitus.[36]\\n\\nOvulation suppression\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nCombined hormonal contraceptives inhibit follicular development and prevent ovulation as a primary mechanism of action.[37] The ovulation-inhibiting dose (OID) of an estrogen or progestogen refers to the dose required to consistently inhibit ovulation in women.[38] Ovulation inhibition is an antigonadotropic effect and is mediated by inhibition of the secretion of the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, from the pituitary gland.\\n\\nIn assisted reproductive technology including in vitro fertilization, cycles where a transvaginal oocyte retrieval is planned generally necessitates ovulation suppression, because it is not practically feasible to collect oocytes after ovulation. For this purpose, ovulation can be suppressed by either a GnRH agonist or a GnRH antagonist, with different protocols depending on which substance is used.\\n\\nFurther information: Suppression of spontaneous ovulation in ovarian hyperstimulation\\n\\nFertility and timing of ovulation\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nMost women who are able to conceive are fertile for an estimated five days before ovulation and one day after ovulation.[39] There is some evidence that for couples who have been trying to conceive a child for less than 12 months, and the female is under 40 years old, practicing timed intercourse (timing intercourse with ovulation using urine tests that predict ovulation) may help improve the rate of pregnancy and live births.[39] The role that stress plays in ovulation, fertility, and understanding the biological basis for stress-induced anovulation and the role of cortisol is not entirely clear.[40]\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\nAnovulatory cycle\\n\\nCorpus luteum\\n\\nFolliculogenesis\\n\\nMenstrual cycle\\n\\nOogenesis\\n\\nMittelschmerz\\n\\nFertilisation\\n\\nNotes\\n\\n[edit]\\n\\n^ Holesh, Julie E.; Bass, Autumn N.; Lord, Megan (2024), \"Physiology, Ovulation\", StatPearls, Treasure Island (FL): StatPearls Publishing, PMID 28723025, retrieved 2024-11-20\\n\\n^ Young B (2006).

That\\'s why we put together a complete guide to keeping your mood light, managing your symptoms, and planning around your period, so that you can get on with your life, even when you are on your period.\\n\\nThings You Should Know\\n\\nMake it a point to do things you enjoy during your period, like getting spa day or dressing up, to make it feel less restricting.\\n\\nReduce your symptoms by reducing your sugar, salt, and coffee intake while on your period.\\n\\nDo some light exercise each day, like a quick walk or a run, to keep your body limber, your mind light, and your symptoms at bay.\\n\\nSteps\\n\\nPart 1\\n\\nPart 1 of 3:\\n\\nHaving Fun on Your Period\\n\\nPDF download\\n\\nDownload Article\\n\\nHave a ritual of watching comedy. The first day of your period can be frustrating. You may have physical symptoms or feel emotionally vulnerable. Therefore, make it a monthly ritual to watch some comedy to lighten your mood on day one. Peruse YouTube, your DVD collection, or Netflix and find something that will make you laugh. Comedy will provide you with entertainment and take your mind off any symptoms you may be experiencing. If you want, you can make a point of watching a particular movie or TV series during the first day of your period.\\n\\nPamper yourself. Periods can be tough on your body, so do something to pamper yourself to help alleviate symptoms. You may actually enjoy periods more if you use them as an excuse for pampering you may not do otherwise. If you ache all over, book a massage at your favorite salon and enjoy an hour of relaxation. Get a manicure and pick a bright color so you smile every time you glance at your nails. Take a really hot bubble bath while you read a book. Indulge in something that will make you feel happy, relaxed, and refreshed.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nGet dressed up. Many people feel bloated and unattractive during their periods. You can fight that feeling by using your period as an excuse to dress up. Resist the urge to lay around in sweatpants all day. Get yourself dolled up and go out with your friends. Make this a monthly ritual each time you have your period. Whether you’re trying a new restaurant or doing some shopping, put on an outfit that you feel good in, take the steps you take to feel clean and beautiful, and see how much better you feel.\\n\\nDon’t be afraid to wear cute underwear while you’re on your period. You’re probably going to reach for your most worn out pair of undies, but resist! Boring skivvies can put a damper on your mood, so put a pair on that make you feel great. If you’re afraid of stains, a thin pantyliner can solve that problem.[1] X Research source\\n\\nRelax. Being active can be fun and does wonders for your period symptoms, but don’t be afraid to take it easy either. Your period may make you feel drained on some days, and physical symptoms may be worse during some parts of your cycle. Give yourself the excuse to relax on certain days of your menstrual cycle.\\n\\nMake some snacks (bonus points if they’re ones that reduce symptoms), find a movie, and snuggle on the couch for a while. Sometimes the best thing for your body is rest. Don’t feel guilty for vegging out for a couple of hours while you watch something good on TV.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPart 2\\n\\nPart 2 of 3:\\n\\nReducing Period Symptoms\\n\\nPDF download\\n\\nDownload Article\\n\\nWatch what you eat. It’s okay to give in to cravings once in a while. If you are constantly eating milk chocolate while you’re on your period, however, you might actually be doing yourself a disservice. Sugar, salt, and coffee can aggravate your symptoms and actually make them worse. Try to avoid these foods in the time leading up to and during your period.\\n\\nWhy are sugar, salt, and coffee bad? Sugar spikes your blood sugar which can actually make you more irritable. Salt can cause you to feel even more bloated, and caffeine elevates estrogen production, which can cause more extreme PMS symptoms.[2] X Research source\\n\\nTry to consume leafy greens, salmon, whole grains, bananas, and yogurt instead. Packed with all sorts of vitamins, these foods will reduce your symptoms so you can enjoy yourself and forget about your period.\\n\\nMove. You may be tempted to curl up on the sofa and watch television all day, but you’ll actually feel happier if you get up and move around. Exercise reduces your symptoms, like cramping and bloating, and releases mood-boosting endorphins. Your body temperature is actually lower when you’re on your period too, so you’ll stay cooler.\\n\\nYou don’t necessarily need to run a marathon or hike a mountain to get some exercise. Grab a friend and try a spin class, take your dog for a walk around your neighborhood, or break out your yoga mat and do some sun salutations. Anything that gets your body moving and active will make you feel better.\\n\\nLeaks sometimes happen during exercise. Therefore, it\\'s a good idea to use a tampon over a pad to prevent leaks. If you\\'re having a particularly heavy month, using a tampon and a pad may help with leak protection. You could also try wearing darker workout clothes in case a leak occurs.\\n\\nTry essential oils. Essential oils are a natural way to perk yourself up when you’re feeling sluggish. Add a few drops to a hot bath or massage it into your temples and wrists. The smell alone will make you feel more happy and relaxed.\\n\\nThere are a lot of different oils out there, but a few, in particular, can be helpful during your period. Bergamot and clary sage keep your mood stable, geranium is wonderful if you’re feeling crabby, and lavender helps you relax. White peppermint can relieve headaches and grapefruit and lemon are great for bloating.[3] X Research source\\n\\nAddress stress. If you’re stressed out, your period symptoms may be even more extreme. Take some time to think about what is stressing you out. If it’s something you can easily address, take care of it so it’s off your mind. If it’s something out of your control, remind yourself of that and try to relax with a bubble bath, yoga, or meditation.\\n\\nTake pain relievers. If you’re experiencing substantial cramping, breast tenderness, backaches, or headaches, and nothing natural seems to be working, you may want to try taking a pain reliever. These pain relievers include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). You can also try remedies specially made for PMS symptoms like Pamprin and Midol.\\n\\nAlways follow the dosage information on the bottle and talk to your doctor if you’re unsure or have any questions before taking medication.\\n\\nUse heating pads. Another common way of dealing with periods is a heating pad. As a heating pad can be comforting, this also may help you enjoy your period. See cramps as an excuse to indulge in this luxury.[4] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world\\'s leading hospitals Go to source\\n\\nYou can purchase a heating pad at most drug stores. Make sure you read instructions before use, as some heating pads should be wrapped in a blanket or towel.\\n\\nNever leave a heating pad plugged in overnight or unattended.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPart 3\\n\\nPart 3 of 3:\\n\\nPlanning Ahead\\n\\nPDF download\\n\\nDownload Article\\n\\nKnow when it’s coming. Nothing puts a damper on brunch with your friends like unexpectedly getting your period, in white pants no less. While you can’t always pinpoint the exact hour you’ll get your period, you can usually plan for a general timeframe. If you know it’s going to happen, you’ll be more prepared and can avoid potential mishaps.[5] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020.\\n\\nMarking the general time your period will arrive each month with a discreet red dot in your planner or your phone’s calendar is an easy way to remind yourself when it will happen. They even make apps, like Period Tracker, that help you keep track of your flow.\\n\\nWearing a super thin pad, period underwear or a pantyliner around the time you’re expecting your period can prevent a leak.\\n\\nDon’t feel self-conscious. Think about it. How often have you cringed seeing a person buying tampons? Have you ever actually looked at somebody and thought, \\'they smell like they\\'re on their period\\'. Probably not. While you don’t necessarily need to advertise that you’re on your period, you don’t need to feel embarrassed or paranoid either.[6] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020.\\n\\nIf you get caught off guard with your period, don’t be afraid to ask somebody for a tampon or pad. A lot of people have periods and many of them have been caught in the same situation. Nobody is going to laugh or make fun of you.\\n\\nRemind yourself periods are a good thing. While they may seem like a nuisance, periods mean you’re in excellent health and your body is performing like it’s meant to. Your brain is sending chemical messages to your ovaries so you’re producing hormones like estrogen and androgens, both of which are extremely important. If you remind yourself of that, it allows you to appreciate what’s happening with your body and then focus on other fun things in life.\\n\\nIf you are transgender or nonbinary (or don\\'t identify as a woman), try not to be ashamed of your period. Millions of people have periods but don\\'t identify as a woman.\\n\\nUse the best menstrual product for your body. There are numerous options today in the world of menstrual products including pads, tampons, menstrual cups, sponges, and more. If you’re using one product but you find it uncomfortable, try another product![7] X Expert Source Rebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist Expert Interview. 3 April 2020. Don’t feel like you have to use a certain product just because that’s what your friends use. Find the most comfortable option for your body because when you’re comfortable, you’re less likely to even notice you’re on your period.\\n\\nWork around irregularity. You may have irregular periods, which can make planning for and then enjoying your time of month difficult. Irregular periods are periods that do not come every month. They are also periods that are sometimes very heavy, while other times very light. If you have irregular periods, talk to your doctor about how to treat the issue. This way, you\\'ll be more able to plan for your period.[8] X Trustworthy Source Mayo Clinic Educational website from one of the world\\'s leading hospitals Go to source\\n\\nIf you have just started your period, it\\'s common for your period to be irregular for the first few years. Irregular periods can be caused by a variety of health conditions, such as ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disease, and habits like exercise and weight loss. If your periods are irregular, finding the cause can cut back on worry. This can allow you to enjoy your periods more when they do occur.\\n\\nYour doctor may be able to treat your irregular periods. Birth control can help control your period. Talk to your doctor about getting on birth control if irregular menstruation prevents you from enjoying your period.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nExpert Q&A\\n\\nSearch\\n\\nAdd New Question\\n\\nQuestion\\n\\nWhat happens if my tampon string breaks?\\n\\nRebecca Levy-Gantt, MPT, DO Board Certified Obstetrician & Gynecologist\\n\\nDr. Rebecca Levy-Gantt is a board certified Obstetrician and Gynecologist running a private practice based in Napa, California.

Mark the general time your period will likely arrive or use an app, like Period Tracker, so you can be prepared.

You’ll also want to get some exercise, which can reduce bloating and cramps as well as release mood-boosting hormones. Another way to enjoy your period is to pamper yourself. For example, have a ritual of watching a comedy on the first day of your period. Another way to make yourself happy and relaxed is to get a monthly manicure or take a hot bubble bath.

Henigsman, DO — Written by Sian Ferguson — Updated on December 23, 2024\\n\\nEating certain foods while on your period, including fruit and leafy veggies, may reduce symptoms, while others, such as spicy foods and red meat, may make them more severe.\\n\\nMany people have uncomfortable symptoms during menstruation. Some foods and beverages can lessen these symptoms, while others can make them worse. These symptoms include:\\n\\nabdominal cramps\\n\\nheadaches\\n\\nnausea\\n\\nfatigue\\n\\nbloating\\n\\nmood changes\\n\\ndiarrhea\\n\\nIf you experience any of these symptoms, adding certain foods and beverages to your diet and removing others may help you feel better.\\n\\nWhat to drink or eat\\n\\n1. Water\\n\\nDrinking a lot of water is always important, and this is especially true during your period. Staying hydrated can reduce your chances of getting dehydration headaches, a common symptom of menstruation.\\n\\nDrinking plenty of water can also stop you from retaining water and bloating.\\n\\n2. Fruit\\n\\nWater-rich fruits, such as watermelon and cucumber, are great for staying hydrated.\\n\\nSweet fruits can help you curb your sugar cravings without eating a lot of refined sugars, which can cause your glucose levels to spike and then crash.\\n\\n3. Leafy green vegetables\\n\\nIt’s common to experience a dip in your iron levels during your period, particularly if your menstrual flow is heavy. This can lead to fatigue, bodily pain, and dizziness.\\n\\nLeafy green vegetables such as kale and spinach can boost your iron levels. Spinach is also rich in magnesium.\\n\\n4. Ginger\\n\\nA warm mug of ginger tea can improve certain symptoms of menstruation. Ginger has anti-inflammatory effects, which can soothe achy muscles.\\n\\nGinger may also reduce nausea. Few studies confirm this, but a 2018 study found that ginger effectively reduced nausea and vomiting during the first trimester of pregnancy. Since it’s safe and relatively cheap, it’s worth trying.\\n\\nDon’t consume too much ginger, though: Consuming more than 4 grams in one day could cause heartburn and stomachaches.\\n\\n5. Chicken\\n\\nChicken is another iron- and protein-rich food you can add to your diet. Protein is essential for overall health, and it can help you stay full and sated during your period, curbing cravings.\\n\\n6. Fish\\n\\nRich in iron, protein, and omega-3 fatty acids, fish is a nutritious addition to your diet. Consuming iron will counteract the dip in iron levels that you might experience while menstruating.\\n\\nAccording to a , omega-3s can reduce the intensity of period pain. Subjects who took omega-3 supplements found that their menstrual pain decreased so much that they could reduce the amount of ibuprofen they took.\\n\\nA showed that omega-3s can also reduce depression. For those who experience mood changes and depression around menstruation, omega-3s may be helpful.\\n\\n7. Turmeric\\n\\nTurmeric is known as an anti-inflammatory spice, and curcumin is its main active ingredient. A 2015 study looked at the effects of curcumin on PMS symptoms and found that people who took curcumin had less severe symptoms.\\n\\n8. Dark chocolate\\n\\nA tasty and beneficial snack, dark chocolate is rich in iron and magnesium.\\n\\nA found that magnesium reduced the severity of PMS symptoms. According to a , people with magnesium deficiencies were more likely to have severe PMS symptoms.\\n\\n9. Nuts\\n\\nMost nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, and they’re a great source of protein. They also contain magnesium and various vitamins.\\n\\nIf you don’t want to eat nuts on their own, try nut butter or nut-based milk or add these ingredients to smoothies.\\n\\n10. Flaxseed oil\\n\\nA small 2015 study found that consuming flaxseed oil soothed constipation, a common symptom of menstruation. However, more research is needed to show how flaxseed oil can improve digestive health.\\n\\n11. Quinoa\\n\\nQuinoa is rich in nutrients such as iron, protein, and magnesium. It’s also gluten-free, so it’s a great food for those with celiac disease.\\n\\nPlus, it has a low glycemic index, which means you’re likely to feel full and have energy for a long time after eating it.\\n\\n12. Lentils and beans\\n\\nLentils and beans are rich in protein, so they’re good meat replacements for vegans and vegetarians. They’re also rich in iron, which makes them great additions to your diet if your iron levels are low.\\n\\n13. Yogurt\\n\\nMany people get yeast infections during or after their period.\\n\\nIf you tend to get yeast infections, probiotic-rich foods like yogurt can nourish the “good” bacteria in your vagina and may help you fight the infections.\\n\\nYogurt is also rich in magnesium and other essential nutrients, like calcium.\\n\\n14. Tofu\\n\\nTofu, made from soybeans, is a popular source of protein for vegetarians and vegans. It’s also rich in iron, magnesium, and calcium.\\n\\n15. Peppermint tea\\n\\nA 2016 study suggests that peppermint tea can soothe the symptoms of PMS. Specifically, it can relieve menstrual cramps, nausea, and diarrhea.\\n\\n16. Kombucha\\n\\nYogurt isn’t the only probiotic-rich food with yeast-fighting benefits. If you’re avoiding dairy, kombucha tea is a great fermented food that’s more widely available than ever before.\\n\\nTry to avoid kombucha drinks that contain too much sugar.\\n\\nWhat to limit or avoid\\n\\n1. Salt\\n\\nConsuming a lot of salt leads to water retention, which can result in bloating. To reduce bloating, avoid adding salt to your foods and highly processed foods that contain a lot of sodium.\\n\\n2. Sugar\\n\\nIt’s OK to have sugar in moderation, but eating too much of it can cause a spike in energy followed by a crash. This can worsen your mood.\\n\\nIf you tend to feel depressed or anxious during your period, watching your sugar intake can help regulate your mood.\\n\\n3. Coffee\\n\\nCaffeine can cause water retention and bloating. It can also exacerbate headaches. But caffeine withdrawal can cause headaches, too, so don’t cut out coffee completely if you’re used to having a few cups a day.\\n\\nCoffee might also cause digestive issues. If you tend to get diarrhea during your period, reducing your coffee intake could help prevent this.\\n\\n4. Alcohol\\n\\nAlcohol can have a number of negative effects on your body, which can exacerbate the symptoms of your period.\\n\\nFor example, alcohol can dehydrate you, which can worsen headaches and cause bloating. It can also lead to digestive issues, such as diarrhea and nausea.\\n\\nPlus, a hangover can bring on some of the same symptoms that occur during your period, including:\\n\\nheadaches\\n\\nnausea\\n\\nvomiting\\n\\ndiarrhea\\n\\nfatigue\\n\\n5. Spicy foods\\n\\nMany people find that spicy foods upset their stomachs, giving them diarrhea, stomach pain, and even nausea.\\n\\nIf your stomach struggles to tolerate spicy foods or if you’re not used to eating them, it might be best to avoid them during your period.\\n\\n6. Red meat\\n\\nRed meat may be high in iron, but it is also high in prostaglandins.\\n\\nDuring your period, your body produces prostaglandins. These compounds help your uterus contract and get rid of the uterine lining, resulting in your menstrual flow. However, high levels of prostaglandins cause cramps.\\n\\n7. Anything you don’t tolerate well\\n\\nThis might seem obvious, but it’s worth emphasizing: If you have food sensitivities, avoid those foods, especially during your period.\\n\\nIf you’re lactose intolerant, you might occasionally treat yourself to a milkshake, regardless. But during your period, it’s especially important to avoid the foods that can trigger issues in your body.\\n\\nEating these foods can cause nausea, constipation, or diarrhea, which will only add to your discomfort when you’re having a painful period.\\n\\nThe bottom line\\n\\nThe foods and beverages you choose to add or avoid will largely depend on your specific symptoms and food sensitivities.\\n\\nIf your periods are particularly painful or cause you to have difficulty functioning, consider making an appointment with a healthcare professional. This could be a sign of an underlying health condition that requires treatment.\\n\\nHow we reviewed this article:\\n\\nHealthline has strict sourcing guidelines and relies on peer-reviewed studies, academic research institutions, and medical journals and associations.

It happens around the 14th day of a 28-day menstrual cycle. There are methods to track ovulation such as using a calendar, checking your cervical mucus or using an ovulation predictor kit.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Policy\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nFind Your Ob/Gyn\\n\\nMake an Appointment\\n\\nWhat is ovulation?\\n\\nOvulation is a phase in the menstrual cycle when your ovary releases an egg (ovum). Once an egg leaves your ovary, it travels down your fallopian tube where it waits to be fertilized by sperm. On average, it happens on day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\\n\\nOvulation and your menstrual cycle\\n\\nThe process of ovulation begins when your hypothalamus (a part of your brain) releases gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH causes your pituitary gland (a gland in your brain) to secrete follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH).\\n\\nBetween days six and 14 of your menstrual cycle, FSH causes follicles (small sacs of fluid in your ovaries that contain a developing egg) in one ovary to begin to mature. During days 10 to 14 of the cycle, only one of the developing follicles forms a fully mature egg. Around day 14 in the menstrual cycle, a sudden surge in LH causes the ovary to release this egg. This is ovulation. After ovulation, the hormone progesterone rises which helps prepare your uterus for pregnancy.\\n\\nOvulation, conception and pregnancy\\n\\nOnce ovulation occurs, your egg travels through your fallopian tube. It’s in your fallopian tube that your egg meets sperm for fertilization. If conception occurs (sperm fertilizes your egg), the fertilized egg travels down to your uterus. After about a week, the fertilized egg (now a blastocyst) attaches to the lining of your uterus. This is called implantation. Release of the hormones estrogen and progesterone causes the endometrium to thicken, which provides the nutrients the blastocyst needs to grow and eventually develop into a baby. As cells continue to divide — some developing into the fetus, others forming the placenta — hormones signal your body that a baby is growing inside your uterus. This also signals your uterus to keep its lining, which prevents you from getting your period. Not getting a period is usually the first sign you’re pregnant.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nWhen does ovulation occur?\\n\\nIn an average 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation occurs about 14 days before the beginning of your next menstrual period. The exact timing varies — your cycle length may be longer or shorter. You may find it helpful to track your menstrual cycle using an app on your phone or a calendar. This can help you determine when ovulation is most likely to occur. Most people will have a period 14 to 16 days after ovulation, regardless of the length of their overall cycle.\\n\\nHow many hours does ovulation last?\\n\\nAn egg only survives 12 to 24 hours after ovulation. If sperm doesn’t’ fertilize the egg, your body reabsorbs it. Unlike your egg, sperm can survive for several days in your body.\\n\\nHow do I know I’m ovulating?\\n\\nPinpointing ovulation can be tricky. There are several methods people use to track their menstrual cycle and estimate when ovulation occurs. Since each method has its drawbacks, it’s always best to use more than one for the most accurate answer.\\n\\nMenstrual cycle\\n\\nOvulation happens at around the midpoint of your cycle if you have a 28-day cycle (day 14). However, a “normal” cycle is anything between 21 and 35 days, so this means ovulation is unique to your menstrual cycle. Keep track of your cycle on paper or on an app on your phone for several months. Take note of any unusual symptoms. Most people ovulate 14 days before their period begins, regardless of cycle length.\\n\\nCalendar method\\n\\nPeople using the calendar method to predict ovulation, analyze six months of menstrual cycles to determine when they’re fertile. To calculate when you may be ovulating, you find your shortest cycle and your longest cycle in a six month period. You subtract 18 days from your shortest cycle and 11 days from your longest cycle. These two numbers give you the days in your cycle you’re most fertile. For example, if your cycle lengths are 31 and 18, your fertile time is day 10 to 20 of your cycle.\\n\\nCervical mucus\\n\\nCervical mucus is a vaginal fluid produced by your cervix. Your cervical mucus goes through stages during your menstrual cycle. Your cervical mucus is thick, white and dry before ovulation. Just before ovulation, your cervical mucus turns clear and slippery (like egg whites). This consistency makes it easy for sperm to swim up to meet your egg.\\n\\nBasal body temperature\\n\\nYour body temperature increases slightly during ovulation (typically about 0.5 to 1 degree). Take your temperature every morning using a digital thermometer meant specifically for measuring basal body temperature. This method only works if you take your temperature before you get out of bed and before you eat/drink. Record your results for several months and note what day of your cycle a temperature increase occurs.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nOvulation kits\\n\\nOvulation kits work similarly to at-home pregnancy tests because you pee on an indicator strip in the comfort of your own home. They work by detecting LH (luteinizing hormone) in your pee. LH is the hormone that surges before ovulation. A positive result means you’re about to ovulate (usually within 36 hours).\\n\\nWhat are the symptoms of ovulation?\\n\\nEvery person is different and not everyone has signs of ovulation. In those that do, the most common symptoms are:\\n\\nTender breasts.\\n\\nBloating.\\n\\nMinor pelvic or abdominal pain.\\n\\nLight bleeding or spotting.\\n\\nChanges in the position and firmness of your cervix.\\n\\nIncreased sex drive.\\n\\nHeightened sense of smell, taste or sight.\\n\\nMood changes.\\n\\nAppetite changes.\\n\\nHow many days during ovulation can you get pregnant?\\n\\nEven though your egg only lives for 24 hours, sperm can live in your uterus for between three and five days. This means you can get pregnant from having sex from about five days before ovulation to one day after ovulation. If pregnancy is your goal, it’s better to have sperm already in your body when you ovulate. The highest probability of conception occurs when intercourse takes place one to two days before ovulation and on the day of ovulation.\\n\\nIs pain during ovulation normal?\\n\\nYes, many people experience ovulation pain. Ovulation pain (or mittelschmerz) is cramping or pelvic pain that happens around ovulation. You typically feel the pain in your lower abdomen and pelvis, in the middle or on one side. Ovulation pain may happen when an egg bursts from a follicle (the sacs in your ovaries that contain eggs). It can even cause light bleeding.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nPain during the time of ovulation may also be caused by a medical condition, so it’s best to contact your healthcare provider to be sure the pain isn’t something more serious.\\n\\nWhat happens if I’m not ovulating?\\n\\nCertain health conditions or life events may affect ovulation or cause you to stop ovulating. Some of these are:\\n\\nBreastfeeding or hyperprolactinemia.\\n\\nMenopause.\\n\\nPCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome).\\n\\nPrimary ovarian insufficiency.\\n\\nAmenorrhea from things like high or low body fat, excessive stress or fatigue or excessive exercise.\\n\\nIf your period is irregular or you go months without a period, you may have not be ovulating. Contact your healthcare provider if this is the case so they can rule out any serious conditions.\\n\\nDo you still ovulate if you’re on birth control?\\n\\nNo, if you’re taking birth control pills or other hormonal contraception as directed, you shouldn’t ovulate. Keep in mind, this is only the case if you’re using pills, patches, IUDs or other devices exactly as prescribed. The hormones in birth control work by stopping ovulation and thickening cervical mucus (which makes it harder for sperm to swim).\\n\\nCan you ovulate but not get your period?\\n\\nYes. You can ovulate but not get your “period.” Technically, if you’re ovulating regularly, you should also get your period regularly. However, it’s possible to get your period without actually ovulating and to ovulate but not have a true period.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nCan medicine help you ovulate?\\n\\nYes, there are fertility medications to induce ovulation. Talk to your healthcare provider about your symptoms and goals, such as if you wish to become pregnant. They can work with you on the best treatment based on your condition.\\n\\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nOvulation is a process that occurs during your menstrual cycle. The exact timing of ovulation varies from person to person and even from cycle to cycle. Without ovulation, it’s hard for you to get pregnant or have regular menstrual periods. There are many methods available to help you predict ovulation. Knowing when you ovulate can help you either achieve a pregnancy or avoid a pregnancy. There are several health conditions that affect ovulation. Contact your healthcare provider if you’re concerned that you’re not ovulating.\\n\\nCare at Cleveland Clinic\\n\\nYour Ob/Gyn is there for you throughout many different parts of your life.
